       "'Title: How do lexical semantics affect translation? An empirical study\\nAbstract: Neural machine translation (NMT) systems aim to map text from one language\\ninto another. While there are a wide variety of applications of NMT, one of the\\nmost important is translation of natural language. A distinguishing factor of\\nnatural language is that words are typically ordered according to the rules of\\nthe grammar of a given language. Although many advances have been made in\\ndeveloping NMT systems for translating natural language, little research has\\nbeen done on understanding how the word ordering of and lexical similarity\\nbetween the source and target language affect translation performance. Here, we\\ninvestigate these relationships on a variety of low-resource language pairs\\nfrom the OpenSubtitles2016 database, where the source language is English, and\\nfind that the more similar the target language is to English, the greater the\\ntranslation performance. In addition, we study the impact of providing NMT\\nmodels with part of speech of words (POS) in the English sequence and find\\nthat, for Transformer-based models, the more dissimilar the target language is\\nfrom English, the greater the benefit provided by POS.'"

Overall, I need to conduct several feasibility studies to identify potential challenges and make a decision about whether or not to proceed.\\n\\nPassages:\\n[1] Title: Image recognition from raw labels collected without annotators Abstract: Image classification problems are typically addressed by first collecting examples with candidate labels, second cleaning the candidate labels manually, and third training a deep neural network on the clean examples. The manual labeling step is often the most expensive one as it requires workers to label millions of images. In this paper we propose to work without any explicitly labeled data by i) directly training the deep neural network on the noisy candidate labels, and ii) early stopping the training to avoid overfitting. With this procedure we exploit an intriguing property of standard overparameterized convolutional neural networks trained with (stochastic) gradient descent: Clean labels are fitted faster than noisy ones. We consider two classification problems, a subset of ImageNet and CIFAR-10. For both, we construct large candidate datasets without any explicit human annotations, that only contain 10%-50% correctly labeled examples per class. We show that training on the candidate examples and regularizing through early stopping gives higher test performance for both problems than when training on the original, clean data. This is possible because the candidate datasets contain a huge number of clean examples, and, as we show in this paper, the noise generated through the label collection process is not nearly as adversarial for learning as the noise generated by randomly flipping labels.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2] Title: Data Troubles in Sentence Level Confidence Estimation for Machine Translation Abstract: The paper investigates the feasibility of confidence estimation for neural machine translation models operating at the high end of the performance spectrum. As a side product of the data annotation process necessary for building such models we propose sentence level accuracy $SACC$ as a simple, self-explanatory evaluation metric for quality of translation. Experiments on two different annotator pools, one comprised of non-expert (crowd-sourced) and one of expert (professional) translators show that $SACC$ can vary greatly depending on the translation proficiency of the annotators, despite the fact that both pools are about equally reliable according to Krippendorff\\'s alpha metric; the relatively low values of inter-annotator agreement confirm the expectation that sentence-level binary labeling $good$ / $needs\\\\ work$ for translation out of context is very hard. For an English-Spanish translation model operating at $SACC = 0.89$ according to a non-expert annotator pool we can derive a confidence estimate that labels 0.5-0.6 of the $good$ translations in an \"in-domain\" test set with 0.95 Precision. Switching to an expert annotator pool decreases $SACC$ dramatically: $0.61$ for English-Spanish, measured on the exact same data as above. This forces us to lower the CE model operating point to 0.9 Precision while labeling correctly about 0.20-0.25 of the $good$ translations in the data. We find surprising the extent to which CE depends on the level of proficiency of the annotator pool used for labeling the data. This leads to an important recommendation we wish to make when tackling CE modeling in practice: it is critical to match the end-user expectation for translation quality in the desired domain with the demands of annotators assigning binary quality labels to CE training data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[3] Title: Jasmine: A New Active Learning Approach to Combat Cybercrime Abstract: Over the past decade, the advent of cybercrime has accelarated the research on cybersecurity. However, the deployment of intrusion detection methods falls short. One of the reasons for this is the lack of realistic evaluation datasets, which makes it a challenge to develop techniques and compare them. This is caused by the large amounts of effort it takes for a cyber analyst to classify network connections. This has raised the need for methods (i) that can learn from small sets of labeled data, (ii) that can make predictions on large sets of unlabeled data, and (iii) that request the label of only specially selected unlabeled data instances. Hence, Active Learning (AL) methods are of interest. These approaches choose specific unlabeled instances by a query function that are expected to improve overall classification performance. The resulting query observations are labeled by a human expert and added to the labeled set. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid AL method called Jasmine. Firstly, it determines how suitable each observation is for querying, i.e., how likely it is to enhance classification. These properties are the uncertainty score and anomaly score. Secondly, Jasmine introduces dynamic updating. This allows the model to adjust the balance between querying uncertain, anomalous and randomly selected observations. To this end, Jasmine is able to learn the best query strategy during the labeling process. This is in contrast to the other AL methods in cybersecurity that all have static, predetermined query functions. We show that dynamic updating, and therefore Jasmine, is able to consistently obtain good and more robust results than querying only uncertainties, only anomalies or a fixed combination of the two.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[4] Title: Adaptive Rule Discovery for Labeling Text Data Abstract: Creating and collecting labeled data is one of the major bottlenecks in machine learning pipelines and the emergence of automated feature generation techniques such as deep learning, which typically requires a lot of training data, has further exacerbated the problem. While weak-supervision techniques have circumvented this bottleneck, existing frameworks either require users to write a set of diverse, high-quality rules to label data (e.g., Snorkel), or require a labeled subset of the data to automatically mine rules (e.g., Snuba). The process of manually writing rules can be tedious and time consuming. At the same time, creating a labeled subset of the data can be costly and even infeasible in imbalanced settings. This is due to the fact that a random sample in imbalanced settings often contains only a few positive instances. To address these shortcomings, we present Darwin, an interactive system designed to alleviate the task of writing rules for labeling text data in weakly-supervised settings. Given an initial labeling rule, Darwin automatically generates a set of candidate rules for the labeling task at hand, and utilizes the annotator\\'s feedback to adapt the candidate rules. We describe how Darwin is scalable and versatile. It can operate over large text corpora (i.e., more than 1 million sentences) and supports a wide range of labeling functions (i.e., any function that can be specified using a context free grammar). Finally, we demonstrate with a suite of experiments over five real-world datasets that Darwin enables annotators to generate weakly-supervised labels efficiently and with a small cost. In fact, our experiments show that rules discovered by Darwin on average identify 40% more positive instances compared to Snuba even when it is provided with 1000 labeled instances.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[5] Title: Time-Sensitive Bayesian Information Aggregation for Crowdsourcing Systems Abstract: Crowdsourcing systems commonly face the problem of aggregating multiple judgments provided by potentially unreliable workers. In addition, several aspects of the design of efficient crowdsourcing processes, such as defining worker\\'s bonuses, fair prices and time limits of the tasks, involve knowledge of the likely duration of the task at hand. Bringing this together, in this work we introduce a new time--sensitive Bayesian aggregation method that simultaneously estimates a task\\'s duration and obtains reliable aggregations of crowdsourced judgments. Our method, called BCCTime, builds on the key insight that the time taken by a worker to perform a task is an important indicator of the likely quality of the produced judgment. To capture this, BCCTime uses latent variables to represent the uncertainty about the workers\\' completion time, the tasks\\' duration and the workers\\' accuracy. To relate the quality of a judgment to the time a worker spends on a task, our model assumes that each task is completed within a latent time window within which all workers with a propensity to genuinely attempt the labelling task (i.e., no spammers) are expected to submit their judgments. In contrast, workers with a lower propensity to valid labeling, such as spammers, bots or lazy labelers, are assumed to perform tasks considerably faster or slower than the time required by normal workers. Specifically, we use efficient message-passing Bayesian inference to learn approximate posterior probabilities of (i) the confusion matrix of each worker, (ii) the propensity to valid labeling of each worker, (iii) the unbiased duration of each task and (iv) the true label of each task. Using two real-world public datasets for entity linking tasks, we show that BCCTime produces up to 11% more accurate classifications and up to 100% more informative estimates of a task\\'s duration\\n\\n---\\n\\n[6] Title: Commit2Vec: Learning Distributed Representations of Code Changes Abstract: Deep learning methods, which have found successful applications in fields like image classification and natural language processing, have recently been applied to source code analysis too, due to the enormous amount of freely available source code (e.g., from open-source software repositories). In this work, we elaborate upon a state-of-the-art approach to the representation of source code that uses information about its syntactic structure, and we adapt it to represent source changes (i.e., commits). We use this representation to classify security-relevant commits. Because our method uses transfer learning (that is, we train a network on a \"pretext task\" for which abundant labeled data is available, and then we use such network for the target task of commit classification, for which fewer labeled instances are available), we studied the impact of pre-training the network using two different pretext tasks versus a randomly initialized model. Our results indicate that representations that leverage the structural information obtained through code syntax outperform token-based representations. Furthermore, the performance metrics obtained when pre-training on a loosely related pretext task with a very large dataset ($>10^6$ samples) were surpassed when pretraining on a smaller dataset ($>10^4$ samples) but for a pretext task that is more closely related to the target task.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[7] Title: Self-Attentive Document Interaction Networks for Permutation Equivariant Ranking Abstract: How to leverage cross-document interactions to improve ranking performance is an important topic in information retrieval (IR) research. However, this topic has not been well-studied in the learning-to-rank setting and most of the existing work still treats each document independently while scoring. The recent development of deep learning shows strength in modeling complex relationships across sequences and sets. It thus motivates us to study how to leverage cross-document interactions for learning-to-rank in the deep learning framework. In this paper, we formally define the permutation-equivariance requirement for a scoring function that captures cross-document interactions. We then propose a self-attention based document interaction network and show that it satisfies the permutation-equivariant requirement, and can generate scores for document sets of varying sizes. Our proposed methods can automatically learn to capture document interactions without any auxiliary information, and can scale across large document sets. We conduct experiments on three ranking datasets: the benchmark Web30k, a Gmail search, and a Google Drive Quick Access dataset. Experimental results show that our proposed methods are both more effective and efficient than baselines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[8] Title: Dating Documents using Graph Convolution Networks Abstract: Document date is essential for many important tasks, such as document retrieval, summarization, event detection, etc. While existing approaches for these tasks assume accurate knowledge of the document date, this is not always available, especially for arbitrary documents from the Web. Document Dating is a challenging problem which requires inference over the temporal structure of the document. Prior document dating systems have largely relied on handcrafted features while ignoring such document internal structures. In this paper, we propose NeuralDater, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based document dating approach which jointly exploits syntactic and temporal graph structures of document in a principled way. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning for the problem of document dating. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we find that NeuralDater significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline by 19% absolute (45% relative) accuracy points.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[9] Title: Coupling the reduced-order model and the generative model for an importance sampling estimator Abstract: In this work, we develop an importance sampling estimator by coupling the reduced-order model and the generative model in a problem setting of uncertainty quantification. The target is to estimate the probability that the quantity of interest (QoI) in a complex system is beyond a given threshold. To avoid the prohibitive cost of sampling a large scale system, the reduced-order model is usually considered for a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. However, the Monte Carlo estimator given by the reduced-order model is biased due to the error from dimension reduction. To correct the bias, we still need to sample the fine model. An effective technique to reduce the variance reduction is importance sampling, where we employ the generative model to estimate the distribution of the data from the reduced-order model and use it for the change of measure in the importance sampling estimator. To compensate the approximation errors of the reduced-order model, more data that induce a slightly smaller QoI than the threshold need to be included into the training set. Although the amount of these data can be controlled by a posterior error estimate, redundant data, which may outnumber the effective data, will be kept due to the epistemic uncertainty. To deal with this issue, we introduce a weighted empirical distribution to process the data from the reduced-order model. The generative model is then trained by minimizing the cross entropy between it and the weighted empirical distribution. We also introduce a penalty term into the objective function to deal with the overfitting for more robustness. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[10] Title: Zero-Shot Open-Book Question Answering Abstract: Open book question answering is a subset of question answering tasks where the system aims to find answers in a given set of documents (open-book) and common knowledge about a topic. This article proposes a solution for answering natural language questions from a corpus of Amazon Web Services (AWS) technical documents with no domain-specific labeled data (zero-shot). These questions can have yes-no-none answers, short answers, long answers, or any combination of the above. This solution comprises a two-step architecture in which a retriever finds the right document and an extractor finds the answers in the retrieved document. We are introducing a new test dataset for open-book QA based on real customer questions on AWS technical documentation. After experimenting with several information retrieval systems and extractor models based on extractive language models, the solution attempts to find the yes-no-none answers and text answers in the same pass. The model is trained on the The Stanford Question Answering Dataset - SQuAD (Rajpurkaret al., 2016) and Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) datasets. We were able to achieve 49% F1 and 39% exact match score (EM) end-to-end with no domain-specific training.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[11] Title: Quality Estimation of English-Hindi Outputs using Naive Bayes Classifier Abstract: In this paper we present an approach for estimating the quality of machine translation system. There are various methods for estimating the quality of output sentences, but in this paper we focus on Na\\\\\"ive Bayes classifier to build model using features which are extracted from the input sentences. These features are used for finding the likelihood of each of the sentences of the training data which are then further used for determining the scores of the test data. On the basis of these scores we determine the class labels of the test data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[12] Title: Beyond Average Performance -- exploring regions of deviating performance for black box classification models Abstract: Machine learning models are becoming increasingly popular in different types of settings. This is mainly caused by their ability to achieve a level of predictive performance that is hard to match by human experts in this new era of big data. With this usage growth comes an increase of the requirements for accountability and understanding of the models\\' predictions. However, the degree of sophistication of the most successful models (e.g. ensembles, deep learning) is becoming a large obstacle to this endeavour as these models are essentially black boxes. In this paper we describe two general approaches that can be used to provide interpretable descriptions of the expected performance of any black box classification model. These approaches are of high practical relevance as they provide means to uncover and describe in an interpretable way situations where the models are expected to have a performance that deviates significantly from their average behaviour. This may be of critical relevance for applications where costly decisions are driven by the predictions of the models, as it can be used to warn end users against the usage of the models in some specific cases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[13] Title: Data Programming: Creating Large Training Sets, Quickly Abstract: Large labeled training sets are the critical building blocks of supervised learning methods and are key enablers of deep learning techniques. For some applications, creating labeled training sets is the most time-consuming and expensive part of applying machine learning. We therefore propose a paradigm for the programmatic creation of training sets called data programming in which users express weak supervision strategies or domain heuristics as labeling functions, which are programs that label subsets of the data, but that are noisy and may conflict. We show that by explicitly representing this training set labeling process as a generative model, we can \"denoise\" the generated training set, and establish theoretically that we can recover the parameters of these generative models in a handful of settings. We then show how to modify a discriminative loss function to make it noise-aware, and demonstrate our method over a range of discriminative models including logistic regression and LSTMs. Experimentally, on the 2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling challenge, we show that data programming would have led to a new winning score, and also show that applying data programming to an LSTM model leads to a TAC-KBP score almost 6 F1 points over a state-of-the-art LSTM baseline (and into second place in the competition). Additionally, in initial user studies we observed that data programming may be an easier way for non-experts to create machine learning models when training data is limited or unavailable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[14] Title: Categorizing Items with Short and Noisy Descriptions using Ensembled Transferred Embeddings Abstract: Item categorization is a machine learning task which aims at classifying e-commerce items, typically represented by textual attributes, to their most suitable category from a predefined set of categories. An accurate item categorization system is essential for improving both the user experience and the operational processes of the company. In this work, we focus on item categorization settings in which the textual attributes representing items are noisy and short, and labels (i.e., accurate classification of items into categories) are not available. In order to cope with such settings, we propose a novel learning framework, Ensembled Transferred Embeddings (ETE), which relies on two key ideas: 1) labeling a relatively small sample of the target dataset, in a semi-automatic process, and 2) leveraging other datasets from related domains or related tasks that are large-scale and labeled, to extract \"transferable embeddings\". Evaluation of ETE on a large-scale real-world dataset provided to us by PayPal, shows that it significantly outperforms traditional as well as state-of-the-art item categorization methods.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[15] Title: An embedded system for the automated generation of labeled plant images to enable machine learning applications in agriculture Abstract: A lack of sufficient training data, both in terms of variety and quantity, is often the bottleneck in the development of machine learning (ML) applications in any domain. For agricultural applications, ML-based models designed to perform tasks such as autonomous plant classification will typically be coupled to just one or perhaps a few plant species. As a consequence, each crop-specific task is very likely to require its own specialized training data, and the question of how to serve this need for data now often overshadows the more routine exercise of actually training such models. To tackle this problem, we have developed an embedded robotic system to automatically generate and label large datasets of plant images for ML applications in agriculture. The system can image plants from virtually any angle, thereby ensuring a wide variety of data; and with an imaging rate of up to one image per second, it can produce lableled datasets on the scale of thousands to tens of thousands of images per day. As such, this system offers an important alternative to time- and cost-intensive methods of manual generation and labeling. Furthermore, the use of a uniform background made of blue keying fabric enables additional image processing techniques such as background replacement and plant segmentation. It also helps in the training process, essentially forcing the model to focus on the plant features and eliminating random correlations. To demonstrate the capabilities of our system, we generated a dataset of over 34,000 labeled images, with which we trained an ML-model to distinguish grasses from non-grasses in test data from a variety of sources. We now plan to generate much larger datasets of Canadian crop plants and weeds that will\\n\\n---\\n\\n[16] Title: DeepScanner: a Robotic System for Automated 2D Object Dataset Collection with Annotations Abstract: In the proposed study, we describe the possibility of automated dataset collection using an articulated robot. The proposed technology reduces the number of pixel errors on a polygonal dataset and the time spent on manual labeling of 2D objects. The paper describes a novel automatic dataset collection and annotation system, and compares the results of automated and manual dataset labeling. Our approach increases the speed of data labeling 240-fold, and improves the accuracy compared to manual labeling 13-fold. We also present a comparison of metrics for training a neural network on a manually annotated and an automatically collected dataset.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[17] Title: Novel and Efficient Approximations for Zero-One Loss of Linear Classifiers Abstract: The predictive quality of machine learning models is typically measured in terms of their (approximate) expected prediction accuracy or the so-called Area Under the Curve (AUC). Minimizing the reciprocals of these measures are the goals of supervised learning. However, when the models are constructed by the means of empirical risk minimization (ERM), surrogate functions such as the logistic loss or hinge loss are optimized instead. In this work, we show that in the case of linear predictors, the expected error and the expected ranking loss can be effectively approximated by smooth functions whose closed form expressions and those of their first (and second) order derivatives depend on the first and second moments of the data distribution, which can be precomputed. Hence, the complexity of an optimization algorithm applied to these functions does not depend on the size of the training data. These approximation functions are derived under the assumption that the output of the linear classifier for a given data set has an approximately normal distribution. We argue that this assumption is significantly weaker than the Gaussian assumption on the data itself and we support this claim by demonstrating that our new approximation is quite accurate on data sets that are not necessarily Gaussian. We present computational results that show that our proposed approximations and related optimization algorithms can produce linear classifiers with similar or better test accuracy or AUC, than those obtained using state-of-the-art approaches, in a fraction of the time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[18] Title: Estimating Rationally Inattentive Utility Functions with Deep Clustering for Framing - Applications in YouTube Engagement Dynamics Abstract: We consider a framework involving behavioral economics and machine learning. Rationally inattentive Bayesian agents make decisions based on their posterior distribution, utility function and information acquisition cost Renyi divergence which generalizes Shannon mutual information). By observing these decisions, how can an observer estimate the utility function and information acquisition cost? Using deep learning, we estimate framing information (essential extrinsic features) that determines the agent\\'s attention strategy. Then we present a preference based inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to test for rational inattention: is the agent an utility maximizer, attention maximizer, and does an information cost function exist that rationalizes the data? The test imposes a Renyi mutual information constraint which impacts how the agent can select attention strategies to maximize their expected utility. The test provides constructive estimates of the utility function and information acquisition cost of the agent. We illustrate these methods on a massive YouTube dataset for characterizing the commenting behavior of users.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[19] Title: Cost-Sensitive Feature-Value Acquisition Using Feature Relevance Abstract: In many real-world machine learning problems, feature values are not readily available. To make predictions, some of the missing features have to be acquired, which can incur a cost in money, computational time, or human time, depending on the problem domain. This leads us to the problem of choosing which features to use at the prediction time. The chosen features should increase the prediction accuracy for a low cost, but determining which features will do that is challenging. The choice should take into account the previously acquired feature values as well as the feature costs. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this problem. The proposed approach chooses the most useful features adaptively based on how relevant they are for the prediction task as well as what the corresponding feature costs are. Our approach uses a generic neural network architecture, which is suitable for a wide range of problems. We evaluate our approach on three cost-sensitive datasets, including Yahoo! Learning to Rank Competition dataset as well as two health datasets. We show that our approach achieves high accuracy with a lower cost than the current state-of-the-art approaches.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[20] Title: Online Model Selection: a Rested Bandit Formulation Abstract: Motivated by a natural problem in online model selection with bandit information, we introduce and analyze a best arm identification problem in the rested bandit setting, wherein arm expected losses decrease with the number of times the arm has been played. The shape of the expected loss functions is similar across arms, and is assumed to be available up to unknown parameters that have to be learned on the fly. We define a novel notion of regret for this problem, where we compare to the policy that always plays the arm having the smallest expected loss at the end of the game. We analyze an arm elimination algorithm whose regret vanishes as the time horizon increases. The actual rate of convergence depends in a detailed way on the postulated functional form of the expected losses. Unlike known model selection efforts in the recent bandit literature, our algorithm exploits the specific structure of the problem to learn the unknown parameters of the expected loss function so as to identify the best arm as quickly as possible. We complement our analysis with a lower bound, indicating strengths and limitations of the proposed solution.\\n\\nYour ranking (most to least relevant):<end_of_turn>\\n<start_of_turn>model\\n[2] > [4] > [5] > [12] > [13] > [1] > [3] > [6] > [7] > [8] > [9] > [10] > [11] > [14] > [15] > [16] > [17] > [18] > [19] > [20]<end_of_turn>\\n',\n",

The manual labeling step is often the most expensive one as it requires workers to label millions of images. In this paper we propose to work without any explicitly labeled data by i) directly training the deep neural network on the noisy candidate labels, and ii) early stopping the training to avoid overfitting. With this procedure we exploit an intriguing property of standard overparameterized convolutional neural networks trained with (stochastic) gradient descent: Clean labels are fitted faster than noisy ones. We consider two classification problems, a subset of ImageNet and CIFAR-10. For both, we construct large candidate datasets without any explicit human annotations, that only contain 10%-50% correctly labeled examples per class. We show that training on the candidate examples and regularizing through early stopping gives higher test performance for both problems than when training on the original, clean data. This is possible because the candidate datasets contain a huge number of clean examples, and, as we show in this paper, the noise generated through the label collection process is not nearly as adversarial for learning as the noise generated by randomly flipping labels.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2] Title: Data Troubles in Sentence Level Confidence Estimation for Machine Translation Abstract: The paper investigates the feasibility of confidence estimation for neural machine translation models operating at the high end of the performance spectrum. As a side product of the data annotation process necessary for building such models we propose sentence level accuracy $SACC$ as a simple, self-explanatory evaluation metric for quality of translation. Experiments on two different annotator pools, one comprised of non-expert (crowd-sourced) and one of expert (professional) translators show that $SACC$ can vary greatly depending on the translation proficiency of the annotators, despite the fact that both pools are about equally reliable according to Krippendorff\\'s alpha metric; the relatively low values of inter-annotator agreement confirm the expectation that sentence-level binary labeling $good$ / $needs\\\\ work$ for translation out of context is very hard. For an English-Spanish translation model operating at $SACC = 0.89$ according to a non-expert annotator pool we can derive a confidence estimate that labels 0.5-0.6 of the $good$ translations in an \"in-domain\" test set with 0.95 Precision. Switching to an expert annotator pool decreases $SACC$ dramatically: $0.61$ for English-Spanish, measured on the exact same data as above. This forces us to lower the CE model operating point to 0.9 Precision while labeling correctly about 0.20-0.25 of the $good$ translations in the data. We find surprising the extent to which CE depends on the level of proficiency of the annotator pool used for labeling the data. This leads to an important recommendation we wish to make when tackling CE modeling in practice: it is critical to match the end-user expectation for translation quality in the desired domain with the demands of annotators assigning binary quality labels to CE training data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[3] Title: Jasmine: A New Active Learning Approach to Combat Cybercrime Abstract: Over the past decade, the advent of cybercrime has accelarated the research on cybersecurity. However, the deployment of intrusion detection methods falls short. One of the reasons for this is the lack of realistic evaluation datasets, which makes it a challenge to develop techniques and compare them. This is caused by the large amounts of effort it takes for a cyber analyst to classify network connections. This has raised the need for methods (i) that can learn from small sets of labeled data, (ii) that can make predictions on large sets of unlabeled data, and (iii) that request the label of only specially selected unlabeled data instances. Hence, Active Learning (AL) methods are of interest. These approaches choose specific unlabeled instances by a query function that are expected to improve overall classification performance. The resulting query observations are labeled by a human expert and added to the labeled set. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid AL method called Jasmine. Firstly, it determines how suitable each observation is for querying, i.e., how likely it is to enhance classification. These properties are the uncertainty score and anomaly score. Secondly, Jasmine introduces dynamic updating. This allows the model to adjust the balance between querying uncertain, anomalous and randomly selected observations. To this end, Jasmine is able to learn the best query strategy during the labeling process. This is in contrast to the other AL methods in cybersecurity that all have static, predetermined query functions. We show that dynamic updating, and therefore Jasmine, is able to consistently obtain good and more robust results than querying only uncertainties, only anomalies or a fixed combination of the two.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[4] Title: Adaptive Rule Discovery for Labeling Text Data Abstract: Creating and collecting labeled data is one of the major bottlenecks in machine learning pipelines and the emergence of automated feature generation techniques such as deep learning, which typically requires a lot of training data, has further exacerbated the problem. While weak-supervision techniques have circumvented this bottleneck, existing frameworks either require users to write a set of diverse, high-quality rules to label data (e.g., Snorkel), or require a labeled subset of the data to automatically mine rules (e.g., Snuba). The process of manually writing rules can be tedious and time consuming. At the same time, creating a labeled subset of the data can be costly and even infeasible in imbalanced settings. This is due to the fact that a random sample in imbalanced settings often contains only a few positive instances. To address these shortcomings, we present Darwin, an interactive system designed to alleviate the task of writing rules for labeling text data in weakly-supervised settings. Given an initial labeling rule, Darwin automatically generates a set of candidate rules for the labeling task at hand, and utilizes the annotator\\'s feedback to adapt the candidate rules. We describe how Darwin is scalable and versatile. It can operate over large text corpora (i.e., more than 1 million sentences) and supports a wide range of labeling functions (i.e., any function that can be specified using a context free grammar). Finally, we demonstrate with a suite of experiments over five real-world datasets that Darwin enables annotators to generate weakly-supervised labels efficiently and with a small cost. In fact, our experiments show that rules discovered by Darwin on average identify 40% more positive instances compared to Snuba even when it is provided with 1000 labeled instances.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[5] Title: Time-Sensitive Bayesian Information Aggregation for Crowdsourcing Systems Abstract: Crowdsourcing systems commonly face the problem of aggregating multiple judgments provided by potentially unreliable workers. In addition, several aspects of the design of efficient crowdsourcing processes, such as defining worker\\'s bonuses, fair prices and time limits of the tasks, involve knowledge of the likely duration of the task at hand. Bringing this together, in this work we introduce a new time--sensitive Bayesian aggregation method that simultaneously estimates a task\\'s duration and obtains reliable aggregations of crowdsourced judgments. Our method, called BCCTime, builds on the key insight that the time taken by a worker to perform a task is an important indicator of the likely quality of the produced judgment. To capture this, BCCTime uses latent variables to represent the uncertainty about the workers\\' completion time, the tasks\\' duration and the workers\\' accuracy. To relate the quality of a judgment to the time a worker spends on a task, our model assumes that each task is completed within a latent time window within which all workers with a propensity to genuinely attempt the labelling task (i.e., no spammers) are expected to submit their judgments. In contrast, workers with a lower propensity to valid labeling, such as spammers, bots or lazy labelers, are assumed to perform tasks considerably faster or slower than the time required by normal workers. Specifically, we use efficient message-passing Bayesian inference to learn approximate posterior probabilities of (i) the confusion matrix of each worker, (ii) the propensity to valid labeling of each worker, (iii) the unbiased duration of each task and (iv) the true label of each task. Using two real-world public datasets for entity linking tasks, we show that BCCTime produces up to 11% more accurate classifications and up to 100% more informative estimates of a task\\'s duration\\n\\n---\\n\\n[6] Title: Commit2Vec: Learning Distributed Representations of Code Changes Abstract: Deep learning methods, which have found successful applications in fields like image classification and natural language processing, have recently been applied to source code analysis too, due to the enormous amount of freely available source code (e.g., from open-source software repositories). In this work, we elaborate upon a state-of-the-art approach to the representation of source code that uses information about its syntactic structure, and we adapt it to represent source changes (i.e., commits). We use this representation to classify security-relevant commits. Because our method uses transfer learning (that is, we train a network on a \"pretext task\" for which abundant labeled data is available, and then we use such network for the target task of commit classification, for which fewer labeled instances are available), we studied the impact of pre-training the network using two different pretext tasks versus a randomly initialized model. Our results indicate that representations that leverage the structural information obtained through code syntax outperform token-based representations. Furthermore, the performance metrics obtained when pre-training on a loosely related pretext task with a very large dataset ($>10^6$ samples) were surpassed when pretraining on a smaller dataset ($>10^4$ samples) but for a pretext task that is more closely related to the target task.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[7] Title: Self-Attentive Document Interaction Networks for Permutation Equivariant Ranking Abstract: How to leverage cross-document interactions to improve ranking performance is an important topic in information retrieval (IR) research. However, this topic has not been well-studied in the learning-to-rank setting and most of the existing work still treats each document independently while scoring. The recent development of deep learning shows strength in modeling complex relationships across sequences and sets. It thus motivates us to study how to leverage cross-document interactions for learning-to-rank in the deep learning framework. In this paper, we formally define the permutation-equivariance requirement for a scoring function that captures cross-document interactions. We then propose a self-attention based document interaction network and show that it satisfies the permutation-equivariant requirement, and can generate scores for document sets of varying sizes. Our proposed methods can automatically learn to capture document interactions without any auxiliary information, and can scale across large document sets. We conduct experiments on three ranking datasets: the benchmark Web30k, a Gmail search, and a Google Drive Quick Access dataset. Experimental results show that our proposed methods are both more effective and efficient than baselines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[8] Title: Dating Documents using Graph Convolution Networks Abstract: Document date is essential for many important tasks, such as document retrieval, summarization, event detection, etc. While existing approaches for these tasks assume accurate knowledge of the document date, this is not always available, especially for arbitrary documents from the Web. Document Dating is a challenging problem which requires inference over the temporal structure of the document. Prior document dating systems have largely relied on handcrafted features while ignoring such document internal structures. In this paper, we propose NeuralDater, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based document dating approach which jointly exploits syntactic and temporal graph structures of document in a principled way. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning for the problem of document dating. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we find that NeuralDater significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline by 19% absolute (45% relative) accuracy points.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[9] Title: Coupling the reduced-order model and the generative model for an importance sampling estimator Abstract: In this work, we develop an importance sampling estimator by coupling the reduced-order model and the generative model in a problem setting of uncertainty quantification. The target is to estimate the probability that the quantity of interest (QoI) in a complex system is beyond a given threshold. To avoid the prohibitive cost of sampling a large scale system, the reduced-order model is usually considered for a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. However, the Monte Carlo estimator given by the reduced-order model is biased due to the error from dimension reduction. To correct the bias, we still need to sample the fine model. An effective technique to reduce the variance reduction is importance sampling, where we employ the generative model to estimate the distribution of the data from the reduced-order model and use it for the change of measure in the importance sampling estimator. To compensate the approximation errors of the reduced-order model, more data that induce a slightly smaller QoI than the threshold need to be included into the training set. Although the amount of these data can be controlled by a posterior error estimate, redundant data, which may outnumber the effective data, will be kept due to the epistemic uncertainty. To deal with this issue, we introduce a weighted empirical distribution to process the data from the reduced-order model. The generative model is then trained by minimizing the cross entropy between it and the weighted empirical distribution. We also introduce a penalty term into the objective function to deal with the overfitting for more robustness. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[10] Title: Zero-Shot Open-Book Question Answering Abstract: Open book question answering is a subset of question answering tasks where the system aims to find answers in a given set of documents (open-book) and common knowledge about a topic. This article proposes a solution for answering natural language questions from a corpus of Amazon Web Services (AWS) technical documents with no domain-specific labeled data (zero-shot). These questions can have yes-no-none answers, short answers, long answers, or any combination of the above. This solution comprises a two-step architecture in which a retriever finds the right document and an extractor finds the answers in the retrieved document. We are introducing a new test dataset for open-book QA based on real customer questions on AWS technical documentation. After experimenting with several information retrieval systems and extractor models based on extractive language models, the solution attempts to find the yes-no-none answers and text answers in the same pass. The model is trained on the The Stanford Question Answering Dataset - SQuAD (Rajpurkaret al., 2016) and Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) datasets. We were able to achieve 49% F1 and 39% exact match score (EM) end-to-end with no domain-specific training.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[11] Title: Quality Estimation of English-Hindi Outputs using Naive Bayes Classifier Abstract: In this paper we present an approach for estimating the quality of machine translation system. There are various methods for estimating the quality of output sentences, but in this paper we focus on Na\\\\\"ive Bayes classifier to build model using features which are extracted from the input sentences. These features are used for finding the likelihood of each of the sentences of the training data which are then further used for determining the scores of the test data. On the basis of these scores we determine the class labels of the test data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[12] Title: Beyond Average Performance -- exploring regions of deviating performance for black box classification models Abstract: Machine learning models are becoming increasingly popular in different types of settings. This is mainly caused by their ability to achieve a level of predictive performance that is hard to match by human experts in this new era of big data. With this usage growth comes an increase of the requirements for accountability and understanding of the models\\' predictions. However, the degree of sophistication of the most successful models (e.g. ensembles, deep learning) is becoming a large obstacle to this endeavour as these models are essentially black boxes. In this paper we describe two general approaches that can be used to provide interpretable descriptions of the expected performance of any black box classification model. These approaches are of high practical relevance as they provide means to uncover and describe in an interpretable way situations where the models are expected to have a performance that deviates significantly from their average behaviour. This may be of critical relevance for applications where costly decisions are driven by the predictions of the models, as it can be used to warn end users against the usage of the models in some specific cases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[13] Title: Data Programming: Creating Large Training Sets, Quickly Abstract: Large labeled training sets are the critical building blocks of supervised learning methods and are key enablers of deep learning techniques. For some applications, creating labeled training sets is the most time-consuming and expensive part of applying machine learning. We therefore propose a paradigm for the programmatic creation of training sets called data programming in which users express weak supervision strategies or domain heuristics as labeling functions, which are programs that label subsets of the data, but that are noisy and may conflict. We show that by explicitly representing this training set labeling process as a generative model, we can \"denoise\" the generated training set, and establish theoretically that we can recover the parameters of these generative models in a handful of settings. We then show how to modify a discriminative loss function to make it noise-aware, and demonstrate our method over a range of discriminative models including logistic regression and LSTMs. Experimentally, on the 2014 TAC-KBP Slot Filling challenge, we show that data programming would have led to a new winning score, and also show that applying data programming to an LSTM model leads to a TAC-KBP score almost 6 F1 points over a state-of-the-art LSTM baseline (and into second place in the competition). Additionally, in initial user studies we observed that data programming may be an easier way for non-experts to create machine learning models when training data is limited or unavailable.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[14] Title: Categorizing Items with Short and Noisy Descriptions using Ensembled Transferred Embeddings Abstract: Item categorization is a machine learning task which aims at classifying e-commerce items, typically represented by textual attributes, to their most suitable category from a predefined set of categories. An accurate item categorization system is essential for improving both the user experience and the operational processes of the company. In this work, we focus on item categorization settings in which the textual attributes representing items are noisy and short, and labels (i.e., accurate classification of items into categories) are not available. In order to cope with such settings, we propose a novel learning framework, Ensembled Transferred Embeddings (ETE), which relies on two key ideas: 1) labeling a relatively small sample of the target dataset, in a semi-automatic process, and 2) leveraging other datasets from related domains or related tasks that are large-scale and labeled, to extract \"transferable embeddings\". Evaluation of ETE on a large-scale real-world dataset provided to us by PayPal, shows that it significantly outperforms traditional as well as state-of-the-art item categorization methods.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[15] Title: An embedded system for the automated generation of labeled plant images to enable machine learning applications in agriculture Abstract: A lack of sufficient training data, both in terms of variety and quantity, is often the bottleneck in the development of machine learning (ML) applications in any domain. For agricultural applications, ML-based models designed to perform tasks such as autonomous plant classification will typically be coupled to just one or perhaps a few plant species. As a consequence, each crop-specific task is very likely to require its own specialized training data, and the question of how to serve this need for data now often overshadows the more routine exercise of actually training such models. To tackle this problem, we have developed an embedded robotic system to automatically generate and label large datasets of plant images for ML applications in agriculture. The system can image plants from virtually any angle, thereby ensuring a wide variety of data; and with an imaging rate of up to one image per second, it can produce lableled datasets on the scale of thousands to tens of thousands of images per day. As such, this system offers an important alternative to time- and cost-intensive methods of manual generation and labeling. Furthermore, the use of a uniform background made of blue keying fabric enables additional image processing techniques such as background replacement and plant segmentation. It also helps in the training process, essentially forcing the model to focus on the plant features and eliminating random correlations. To demonstrate the capabilities of our system, we generated a dataset of over 34,000 labeled images, with which we trained an ML-model to distinguish grasses from non-grasses in test data from a variety of sources. We now plan to generate much larger datasets of Canadian crop plants and weeds that will\\n\\n---\\n\\n[16] Title: DeepScanner: a Robotic System for Automated 2D Object Dataset Collection with Annotations Abstract: In the proposed study, we describe the possibility of automated dataset collection using an articulated robot. The proposed technology reduces the number of pixel errors on a polygonal dataset and the time spent on manual labeling of 2D objects. The paper describes a novel automatic dataset collection and annotation system, and compares the results of automated and manual dataset labeling. Our approach increases the speed of data labeling 240-fold, and improves the accuracy compared to manual labeling 13-fold. We also present a comparison of metrics for training a neural network on a manually annotated and an automatically collected dataset.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[17] Title: Novel and Efficient Approximations for Zero-One Loss of Linear Classifiers Abstract: The predictive quality of machine learning models is typically measured in terms of their (approximate) expected prediction accuracy or the so-called Area Under the Curve (AUC). Minimizing the reciprocals of these measures are the goals of supervised learning. However, when the models are constructed by the means of empirical risk minimization (ERM), surrogate functions such as the logistic loss or hinge loss are optimized instead. In this work, we show that in the case of linear predictors, the expected error and the expected ranking loss can be effectively approximated by smooth functions whose closed form expressions and those of their first (and second) order derivatives depend on the first and second moments of the data distribution, which can be precomputed. Hence, the complexity of an optimization algorithm applied to these functions does not depend on the size of the training data. These approximation functions are derived under the assumption that the output of the linear classifier for a given data set has an approximately normal distribution. We argue that this assumption is significantly weaker than the Gaussian assumption on the data itself and we support this claim by demonstrating that our new approximation is quite accurate on data sets that are not necessarily Gaussian. We present computational results that show that our proposed approximations and related optimization algorithms can produce linear classifiers with similar or better test accuracy or AUC, than those obtained using state-of-the-art approaches, in a fraction of the time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[18] Title: Estimating Rationally Inattentive Utility Functions with Deep Clustering for Framing - Applications in YouTube Engagement Dynamics Abstract: We consider a framework involving behavioral economics and machine learning. Rationally inattentive Bayesian agents make decisions based on their posterior distribution, utility function and information acquisition cost Renyi divergence which generalizes Shannon mutual information). By observing these decisions, how can an observer estimate the utility function and information acquisition cost? Using deep learning, we estimate framing information (essential extrinsic features) that determines the agent\\'s attention strategy. Then we present a preference based inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to test for rational inattention: is the agent an utility maximizer, attention maximizer, and does an information cost function exist that rationalizes the data? The test imposes a Renyi mutual information constraint which impacts how the agent can select attention strategies to maximize their expected utility. The test provides constructive estimates of the utility function and information acquisition cost of the agent. We illustrate these methods on a massive YouTube dataset for characterizing the commenting behavior of users.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[19] Title: Cost-Sensitive Feature-Value Acquisition Using Feature Relevance Abstract: In many real-world machine learning problems, feature values are not readily available. To make predictions, some of the missing features have to be acquired, which can incur a cost in money, computational time, or human time, depending on the problem domain. This leads us to the problem of choosing which features to use at the prediction time. The chosen features should increase the prediction accuracy for a low cost, but determining which features will do that is challenging. The choice should take into account the previously acquired feature values as well as the feature costs. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this problem. The proposed approach chooses the most useful features adaptively based on how relevant they are for the prediction task as well as what the corresponding feature costs are. Our approach uses a generic neural network architecture, which is suitable for a wide range of problems. We evaluate our approach on three cost-sensitive datasets, including Yahoo! Learning to Rank Competition dataset as well as two health datasets. We show that our approach achieves high accuracy with a lower cost than the current state-of-the-art approaches.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[20] Title: Online Model Selection: a Rested Bandit Formulation Abstract: Motivated by a natural problem in online model selection with bandit information, we introduce and analyze a best arm identification problem in the rested bandit setting, wherein arm expected losses decrease with the number of times the arm has been played. The shape of the expected loss functions is similar across arms, and is assumed to be available up to unknown parameters that have to be learned on the fly. We define a novel notion of regret for this problem, where we compare to the policy that always plays the arm having the smallest expected loss at the end of the game. We analyze an arm elimination algorithm whose regret vanishes as the time horizon increases. The actual rate of convergence depends in a detailed way on the postulated functional form of the expected losses. Unlike known model selection efforts in the recent bandit literature, our algorithm exploits the specific structure of the problem to learn the unknown parameters of the expected loss function so as to identify the best arm as quickly as possible. We complement our analysis with a lower bound, indicating strengths and limitations of the proposed solution.\\n\\nYour ranking (most to least relevant):<end_of_turn>\\n<start_of_turn>model\\n[2] > [4] > [5] > [12] > [13] > [1] > [3] > [6] > [7] > [8] > [9] > [10] > [11] > [14] > [15] > [16] > [17] > [18] > [19] > [20]<end_of_turn>\\n'"

We observe that semantics is most easily expressed in words, and develop a text-based approach for the evaluation. Given a video summary, a text representation of the video summary is first generated, and an NLP-based metric is then used to measure its semantic distance to ground-truth text summaries written by humans. We show that our technique has higher agreement with human judgment than pixel-based distance metrics. We also release text annotations and ground-truth text summaries for a number of publicly available video datasets, for use by the computer vision community.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2] Title: Selective Attention Encoders by Syntactic Graph Convolutional Networks for Document Summarization Abstract: Abstractive text summarization is a challenging task, and one need to design a mechanism to effectively extract salient information from the source text and then generate a summary. A parsing process of the source text contains critical syntactic or semantic structures, which is useful to generate more accurate summary. However, modeling a parsing tree for text summarization is not trivial due to its non-linear structure and it is harder to deal with a document that includes multiple sentences and their parsing trees. In this paper, we propose to use a graph to connect the parsing trees from the sentences in a document and utilize the stacked graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn the syntactic representation for a document. The selective attention mechanism is used to extract salient information in semantic and structural aspect and generate an abstractive summary. We evaluate our approach on the CNN/Daily Mail text summarization dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed GCNs based selective attention approach outperforms the baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the dataset.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[3] Title: Few-Shot Learning for Opinion Summarization Abstract: Opinion summarization is the automatic creation of text reflecting subjective information expressed in multiple documents, such as user reviews of a product. The task is practically important and has attracted a lot of attention. However, due to the high cost of summary production, datasets large enough for training supervised models are lacking. Instead, the task has been traditionally approached with extractive methods that learn to select text fragments in an unsupervised or weakly-supervised way. Recently, it has been shown that abstractive summaries, potentially more fluent and better at reflecting conflicting information, can also be produced in an unsupervised fashion. However, these models, not being exposed to actual summaries, fail to capture their essential properties. In this work, we show that even a handful of summaries is sufficient to bootstrap generation of the summary text with all expected properties, such as writing style, informativeness, fluency, and sentiment preservation. We start by training a conditional Transformer language model to generate a new product review given other available reviews of the product. The model is also conditioned on review properties that are directly related to summaries; the properties are derived from reviews with no manual effort. In the second stage, we fine-tune a plug-in module that learns to predict property values on a handful of summaries. This lets us switch the generator to the summarization mode. We show on Amazon and Yelp datasets that our approach substantially outperforms previous extractive and abstractive methods in automatic and human evaluation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[4] Title: Improving Persian Document Classification Using Semantic Relations between Words Abstract: With the increase of information, document classification as one of the methods of text mining, plays vital role in many management and organizing information. Document classification is the process of assigning a document to one or more predefined category labels. Document classification includes different parts such as text processing, term selection, term weighting and final classification. The accuracy of document classification is very important. Thus improvement in each part of classification should lead to better results and higher precision. Term weighting has a great impact on the accuracy of the classification. Most of the existing weighting methods exploit the statistical information of terms in documents and do not consider semantic relations between words. In this paper, an automated document classification system is presented that uses a novel term weighting method based on semantic relations between terms. To evaluate the proposed method, three standard Persian corpuses are used. Experiment results show 2 to 4 percent improvement in classification accuracy compared with the best previous designed system for Persian documents.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[5] Title: Improving Document-Level Sentiment Classification Using Importance of Sentences Abstract: Previous researchers have considered sentiment analysis as a document classification task, in which input documents are classified into predefined sentiment classes. Although there are sentences in a document that support important evidences for sentiment analysis and sentences that do not, they have treated the document as a bag of sentences. In other words, they have not considered the importance of each sentence in the document. To effectively determine polarity of a document, each sentence in the document should be dealt with different degrees of importance. To address this problem, we propose a document-level sentence classification model based on deep neural networks, in which the importance degrees of sentences in documents are automatically determined through gate mechanisms. To verify our new sentiment analysis model, we conducted experiments using the sentiment datasets in the four different domains such as movie reviews, hotel reviews, restaurant reviews, and music reviews. In the experiments, the proposed model outperformed previous state-of-the-art models that do not consider importance differences of sentences in a document. The experimental results show that the importance of sentences should be considered in a document-level sentiment classification task.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[6] Title: Document AI: Benchmarks, Models and Applications Abstract: Document AI, or Document Intelligence, is a relatively new research topic that refers to the techniques for automatically reading, understanding, and analyzing business documents. It is an important research direction for natural language processing and computer vision. In recent years, the popularity of deep learning technology has greatly advanced the development of Document AI, such as document layout analysis, visual information extraction, document visual question answering, document image classification, etc. This paper briefly reviews some of the representative models, tasks, and benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we also introduce early-stage heuristic rule-based document analysis, statistical machine learning algorithms, and deep learning approaches especially pre-training methods. Finally, we look into future directions for Document AI research.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[7] Title: Towards Question-Answering as an Automatic Metric for Evaluating the Content Quality of a Summary Abstract: A desirable property of a reference-based evaluation metric that measures the content quality of a summary is that it should estimate how much information that summary has in common with a reference. Traditional text overlap based metrics such as ROUGE fail to achieve this because they are limited to matching tokens, either lexically or via embeddings. In this work, we propose a metric to evaluate the content quality of a summary using question-answering (QA). QA-based methods directly measure a summary's information overlap with a reference, making them fundamentally different than text overlap metrics. We demonstrate the experimental benefits of QA-based metrics through an analysis of our proposed metric, QAEval. QAEval out-performs current state-of-the-art metrics on most evaluations using benchmark datasets, while being competitive on others due to limitations of state-of-the-art models. Through a careful analysis of each component of QAEval, we identify its performance bottlenecks and estimate that its potential upper-bound performance surpasses all other automatic metrics, approaching that of the gold-standard Pyramid Method.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[8] Title: A Semantic QA-Based Approach for Text Summarization Evaluation Abstract: Many Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics applications involves the generation of new texts based on some existing texts, such as summarization, text simplification and machine translation. However, there has been a serious problem haunting these applications for decades, that is, how to automatically and accurately assess quality of these applications. In this paper, we will present some preliminary results on one especially useful and challenging problem in NLP system evaluation: how to pinpoint content differences of two text passages (especially for large pas-sages such as articles and books). Our idea is intuitive and very different from existing approaches. We treat one text passage as a small knowledge base, and ask it a large number of questions to exhaustively identify all content points in it. By comparing the correctly answered questions from two text passages, we will be able to compare their content precisely. The experiment using 2007 DUC summarization corpus clearly shows promising results.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[9] Title: Dimensionality on Summarization Abstract: Summarization is one of the key features of human intelligence. It plays an important role in understanding and representation. With rapid and continual expansion of texts, pictures and videos in cyberspace, automatic summarization becomes more and more desirable. Text summarization has been studied for over half century, but it is still hard to automatically generate a satisfied summary. Traditional methods process texts empirically and neglect the fundamental characteristics and principles of language use and understanding. This paper summarizes previous text summarization approaches in a multi-dimensional classification space, introduces a multi-dimensional methodology for research and development, unveils the basic characteristics and principles of language use and understanding, investigates some fundamental mechanisms of summarization, studies the dimensions and forms of representations, and proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanisms. Investigation extends to the incorporation of pictures into summary and to the summarization of videos, graphs and pictures, and then reaches a general summarization framework.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[10] Title: Document-level Neural Machine Translation with Associated Memory Network Abstract: Standard neural machine translation (NMT) is on the assumption that the document-level context is independent. Most existing document-level NMT approaches are satisfied with a smattering sense of global document-level information, while this work focuses on exploiting detailed document-level context in terms of a memory network. The capacity of the memory network that detecting the most relevant part of the current sentence from memory renders a natural solution to model the rich document-level context. In this work, the proposed document-aware memory network is implemented to enhance the Transformer NMT baseline. Experiments on several tasks show that the proposed method significantly improves the NMT performance over strong Transformer baselines and other related studies.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[11] Title: Improving Multi-Document Summarization via Text Classification Abstract: Developed so far, multi-document summarization has reached its bottleneck due to the lack of sufficient training data and diverse categories of documents. Text classification just makes up for these deficiencies. In this paper, we propose a novel summarization system called TCSum, which leverages plentiful text classification data to improve the performance of multi-document summarization. TCSum projects documents onto distributed representations which act as a bridge between text classification and summarization. It also utilizes the classification results to produce summaries of different styles. Extensive experiments on DUC generic multi-document summarization datasets show that, TCSum can achieve the state-of-the-art performance without using any hand-crafted features and has the capability to catch the variations of summary styles with respect to different text categories.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[12] Title: The Factual Inconsistency Problem in Abstractive Text Summarization: A Survey Abstract: Recently, various neural encoder-decoder models pioneered by Seq2Seq framework have been proposed to achieve the goal of generating more abstractive summaries by learning to map input text to output text. At a high level, such neural models can freely generate summaries without any constraint on the words or phrases used. Moreover, their format is closer to human-edited summaries and output is more readable and fluent. However, the neural model's abstraction ability is a double-edged sword. A commonly observed problem with the generated summaries is the distortion or fabrication of factual information in the article. This inconsistency between the original text and the summary has caused various concerns over its applicability, and the previous evaluation methods of text summarization are not suitable for this issue. In response to the above problems, the current research direction is predominantly divided into two categories, one is to design fact-aware evaluation metrics to select outputs without factual inconsistency errors, and the other is to develop new summarization systems towards factual consistency. In this survey, we focus on presenting a comprehensive review of these fact-specific evaluation methods and text summarization models.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[13] Title: Dating Documents using Graph Convolution Networks Abstract: Document date is essential for many important tasks, such as document retrieval, summarization, event detection, etc. While existing approaches for these tasks assume accurate knowledge of the document date, this is not always available, especially for arbitrary documents from the Web. Document Dating is a challenging problem which requires inference over the temporal structure of the document. Prior document dating systems have largely relied on handcrafted features while ignoring such document internal structures.

We observe that semantics is most easily expressed in words, and develop a text-based approach for the evaluation. Given a video summary, a text representation of the video summary is first generated, and an NLP-based metric is then used to measure its semantic distance to ground-truth text summaries written by humans. We show that our technique has higher agreement with human judgment than pixel-based distance metrics. We also release text annotations and ground-truth text summaries for a number of publicly available video datasets, for use by the computer vision community.\n",

      "[2] Title: Selective Attention Encoders by Syntactic Graph Convolutional Networks for Document Summarization Abstract: Abstractive text summarization is a challenging task, and one need to design a mechanism to effectively extract salient information from the source text and then generate a summary. A parsing process of the source text contains critical syntactic or semantic structures, which is useful to generate more accurate summary. However, modeling a parsing tree for text summarization is not trivial due to its non-linear structure and it is harder to deal with a document that includes multiple sentences and their parsing trees. In this paper, we propose to use a graph to connect the parsing trees from the sentences in a document and utilize the stacked graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to learn the syntactic representation for a document. The selective attention mechanism is used to extract salient information in semantic and structural aspect and generate an abstractive summary. We evaluate our approach on the CNN/Daily Mail text summarization dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed GCNs based selective attention approach outperforms the baselines and achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the dataset.\n",

The task is practically important and has attracted a lot of attention. However, due to the high cost of summary production, datasets large enough for training supervised models are lacking. Instead, the task has been traditionally approached with extractive methods that learn to select text fragments in an unsupervised or weakly-supervised way. Recently, it has been shown that abstractive summaries, potentially more fluent and better at reflecting conflicting information, can also be produced in an unsupervised fashion. However, these models, not being exposed to actual summaries, fail to capture their essential properties. In this work, we show that even a handful of summaries is sufficient to bootstrap generation of the summary text with all expected properties, such as writing style, informativeness, fluency, and sentiment preservation. We start by training a conditional Transformer language model to generate a new product review given other available reviews of the product. The model is also conditioned on review properties that are directly related to summaries; the properties are derived from reviews with no manual effort. In the second stage, we fine-tune a plug-in module that learns to predict property values on a handful of summaries. This lets us switch the generator to the summarization mode. We show on Amazon and Yelp datasets that our approach substantially outperforms previous extractive and abstractive methods in automatic and human evaluation.\n",

      "[4] Title: Improving Persian Document Classification Using Semantic Relations between Words Abstract: With the increase of information, document classification as one of the methods of text mining, plays vital role in many management and organizing information. Document classification is the process of assigning a document to one or more predefined category labels. Document classification includes different parts such as text processing, term selection, term weighting and final classification. The accuracy of document classification is very important. Thus improvement in each part of classification should lead to better results and higher precision. Term weighting has a great impact on the accuracy of the classification. Most of the existing weighting methods exploit the statistical information of terms in documents and do not consider semantic relations between words. In this paper, an automated document classification system is presented that uses a novel term weighting method based on semantic relations between terms. To evaluate the proposed method, three standard Persian corpuses are used. Experiment results show 2 to 4 percent improvement in classification accuracy compared with the best previous designed system for Persian documents.\n",

Although there are sentences in a document that support important evidences for sentiment analysis and sentences that do not, they have treated the document as a bag of sentences. In other words, they have not considered the importance of each sentence in the document. To effectively determine polarity of a document, each sentence in the document should be dealt with different degrees of importance. To address this problem, we propose a document-level sentence classification model based on deep neural networks, in which the importance degrees of sentences in documents are automatically determined through gate mechanisms. To verify our new sentiment analysis model, we conducted experiments using the sentiment datasets in the four different domains such as movie reviews, hotel reviews, restaurant reviews, and music reviews. In the experiments, the proposed model outperformed previous state-of-the-art models that do not consider importance differences of sentences in a document. The experimental results show that the importance of sentences should be considered in a document-level sentiment classification task.\n",

      "[7] Title: Towards Question-Answering as an Automatic Metric for Evaluating the Content Quality of a Summary Abstract: A desirable property of a reference-based evaluation metric that measures the content quality of a summary is that it should estimate how much information that summary has in common with a reference. Traditional text overlap based metrics such as ROUGE fail to achieve this because they are limited to matching tokens, either lexically or via embeddings. In this work, we propose a metric to evaluate the content quality of a summary using question-answering (QA). QA-based methods directly measure a summary's information overlap with a reference, making them fundamentally different than text overlap metrics. We demonstrate the experimental benefits of QA-based metrics through an analysis of our proposed metric, QAEval. QAEval out-performs current state-of-the-art metrics on most evaluations using benchmark datasets, while being competitive on others due to limitations of state-of-the-art models. Through a careful analysis of each component of QAEval, we identify its performance bottlenecks and estimate that its potential upper-bound performance surpasses all other automatic metrics, approaching that of the gold-standard Pyramid Method.\n",

However, there has been a serious problem haunting these applications for decades, that is, how to automatically and accurately assess quality of these applications. In this paper, we will present some preliminary results on one especially useful and challenging problem in NLP system evaluation: how to pinpoint content differences of two text passages (especially for large pas-sages such as articles and books). Our idea is intuitive and very different from existing approaches. We treat one text passage as a small knowledge base, and ask it a large number of questions to exhaustively identify all content points in it. By comparing the correctly answered questions from two text passages, we will be able to compare their content precisely. The experiment using 2007 DUC summarization corpus clearly shows promising results.\n",

With rapid and continual expansion of texts, pictures and videos in cyberspace, automatic summarization becomes more and more desirable. Text summarization has been studied for over half century, but it is still hard to automatically generate a satisfied summary. Traditional methods process texts empirically and neglect the fundamental characteristics and principles of language use and understanding. This paper summarizes previous text summarization approaches in a multi-dimensional classification space, introduces a multi-dimensional methodology for research and development, unveils the basic characteristics and principles of language use and understanding, investigates some fundamental mechanisms of summarization, studies the dimensions and forms of representations, and proposes a multi-dimensional evaluation mechanisms.

The capacity of the memory network that detecting the most relevant part of the current sentence from memory renders a natural solution to model the rich document-level context. In this work, the proposed document-aware memory network is implemented to enhance the Transformer NMT baseline. Experiments on several tasks show that the proposed method significantly improves the NMT performance over strong Transformer baselines and other related studies.\n",

TCSum projects documents onto distributed representations which act as a bridge between text classification and summarization. It also utilizes the classification results to produce summaries of different styles. Extensive experiments on DUC generic multi-document summarization datasets show that, TCSum can achieve the state-of-the-art performance without using any hand-crafted features and has the capability to catch the variations of summary styles with respect to different text categories.\n",

At a high level, such neural models can freely generate summaries without any constraint on the words or phrases used. Moreover, their format is closer to human-edited summaries and output is more readable and fluent. However, the neural model's abstraction ability is a double-edged sword. A commonly observed problem with the generated summaries is the distortion or fabrication of factual information in the article. This inconsistency between the original text and the summary has caused various concerns over its applicability, and the previous evaluation methods of text summarization are not suitable for this issue. In response to the above problems, the current research direction is predominantly divided into two categories, one is to design fact-aware evaluation metrics to select outputs without factual inconsistency errors, and the other is to develop new summarization systems towards factual consistency. In this survey, we focus on presenting a comprehensive review of these fact-specific evaluation methods and text summarization models.\n",

Our experiments demonstrate significant improvement over prior alignment approaches for our task as shown through automatic metrics and a crowd-sourced pyramid analysis. We make our data collection scripts available at https://github.com/manestay/novel-chapter-dataset .\n",

In the context of document classification under topic modeling assumptions, we prove that contrastive learning is capable of recovering a representation of documents that reveals their underlying topic posterior information to linear models. We apply this procedure in a semi-supervised setup and demonstrate empirically that linear classifiers with these representations perform well in document classification tasks with very few training examples.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2] Title: Measuring Disentanglement: A Review of Metrics Abstract: Learning to disentangle and represent factors of variation in data is an important problem in AI. While many advances have been made to learn these representations, it is still unclear how to quantify disentanglement. While several metrics exist, little is known on their implicit assumptions, what they truly measure, and their limits. In consequence, it is difficult to interpret results when comparing different representations. In this work, we survey supervised disentanglement metrics and thoroughly analyze them. We propose a new taxonomy in which all metrics fall into one of three families: intervention-based, predictor-based and information-based. We conduct extensive experiments in which we isolate properties of disentangled representations, allowing stratified comparison along several axes. From our experiment results and analysis, we provide insights on relations between disentangled representation properties. Finally, we share guidelines on how to measure disentanglement.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[3] Title: Image Representation Learning Using Graph Regularized Auto-Encoders Abstract: We consider the problem of image representation for the tasks of unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning. In those learning tasks, the raw image vectors may not provide enough representation for their intrinsic structures due to their highly dense feature space. To overcome this problem, the raw image vectors should be mapped to a proper representation space which can capture the latent structure of the original data and represent the data explicitly for further learning tasks such as clustering. Inspired by the recent research works on deep neural network and representation learning, in this paper, we introduce the multiple-layer auto-encoder into image representation, we also apply the locally invariant ideal to our image representation with auto-encoders and propose a novel method, called Graph regularized Auto-Encoder (GAE). GAE can provide a compact representation which uncovers the hidden semantics and simultaneously respects the intrinsic geometric structure. Extensive experiments on image clustering show encouraging results of the proposed algorithm in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms on real-word cases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[4] Title: P-SIF: Document Embeddings Using Partition Averaging Abstract: Simple weighted averaging of word vectors often yields effective representations for sentences which outperform sophisticated seq2seq neural models in many tasks. While it is desirable to use the same method to represent documents as well, unfortunately, the effectiveness is lost when representing long documents involving multiple sentences. One of the key reasons is that a longer document is likely to contain words from many different topics; hence, creating a single vector while ignoring all the topical structure is unlikely to yield an effective document representation. This problem is less acute in single sentences and other short text fragments where the presence of a single topic is most likely. To alleviate this problem, we present P-SIF, a partitioned word averaging model to represent long documents. P-SIF retains the simplicity of simple weighted word averaging while taking a document\\'s topical structure into account. In particular, P-SIF learns topic-specific vectors from a document and finally concatenates them all to represent the overall document. We provide theoretical justifications on the correctness of P-SIF. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we demonstrate P-SIF\\'s effectiveness compared to simple weighted averaging and many other baselines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[5] Title: Human-interpretable model explainability on high-dimensional data Abstract: The importance of explainability in machine learning continues to grow, as both neural-network architectures and the data they model become increasingly complex. Unique challenges arise when a model\\'s input features become high dimensional: on one hand, principled model-agnostic approaches to explainability become too computationally expensive; on the other, more efficient explainability algorithms lack natural interpretations for general users. In this work, we introduce a framework for human-interpretable explainability on high-dimensional data, consisting of two modules. First, we apply a semantically meaningful latent representation, both to reduce the raw dimensionality of the data, and to ensure its human interpretability. These latent features can be learnt, e.g. explicitly as disentangled representations or implicitly through image-to-image translation, or they can be based on any computable quantities the user chooses. Second, we adapt the Shapley paradigm for model-agnostic explainability to operate on these latent features. This leads to interpretable model explanations that are both theoretically controlled and computationally tractable. We benchmark our approach on synthetic data and demonstrate its effectiveness on several image-classification tasks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[6] Title: Latent Representation Prediction Networks Abstract: Deeply-learned planning methods are often based on learning representations that are optimized for unrelated tasks. For example, they might be trained on reconstructing the environment. These representations are then combined with predictor functions for simulating rollouts to navigate the environment. We find this principle of learning representations unsatisfying and propose to learn them such that they are directly optimized for the task at hand: to be maximally predictable for the predictor function. This results in representations that are by design optimal for the downstream task of planning, where the learned predictor function is used as a forward model. To this end, we propose a new way of jointly learning this representation along with the prediction function, a system we dub Latent Representation Prediction Network (LARP). The prediction function is used as a forward model for search on a graph in a viewpoint-matching task and the representation learned to maximize predictability is found to outperform a pre-trained representation. Our approach is shown to be more sample-efficient than standard reinforcement learning methods and our learned representation transfers successfully to dissimilar objects.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[7] Title: Improve Document Embedding for Text Categorization Through Deep Siamese Neural Network Abstract: Due to the increasing amount of data on the internet, finding a highly-informative, low-dimensional representation for text is one of the main challenges for efficient natural language processing tasks including text classification. This representation should capture the semantic information of the text while retaining their relevance level for document classification. This approach maps the documents with similar topics to a similar space in vector space representation. To obtain representation for large text, we propose the utilization of deep Siamese neural networks. To embed document relevance in topics in the distributed representation, we use a Siamese neural network to jointly learn document representations. Our Siamese network consists of two sub-network of multi-layer perceptron. We examine our representation for the text categorization task on BBC news dataset. The results show that the proposed representations outperform the conventional and state-of-the-art representations in the text classification task on this dataset.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[8] Title: Text Classification and Clustering with Annealing Soft Nearest Neighbor Loss Abstract: We define disentanglement as how far class-different data points from each other are, relative to the distances among class-similar data points. When maximizing disentanglement during representation learning, we obtain a transformed feature representation where the class memberships of the data points are preserved. If the class memberships of the data points are preserved, we would have a feature representation space in which a nearest neighbour classifier or a clustering algorithm would perform well. We take advantage of this method to learn better natural language representation, and employ it on text classification and text clustering tasks. Through disentanglement, we obtain text representations with better-defined clusters and improve text classification performance. Our approach had a test classification accuracy of as high as 90.11% and test clustering accuracy of 88% on the AG News dataset, outperforming our baseline models -- without any other training tricks or regularization.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[9] Title: ViBERTgrid: A Jointly Trained Multi-Modal 2D Document Representation for Key Information Extraction from Documents Abstract: Recent grid-based document representations like BERTgrid allow the simultaneous encoding of the textual and layout information of a document in a 2D feature map so that state-of-the-art image segmentation and/or object detection models can be straightforwardly leveraged to extract key information from documents. However, such methods have not achieved comparable performance to state-of-the-art sequence- and graph-based methods such as LayoutLM and PICK yet. In this paper, we propose a new multi-modal backbone network by concatenating a BERTgrid to an intermediate layer of a CNN model, where the input of CNN is a document image and the BERTgrid is a grid of word embeddings, to generate a more powerful grid-based document representation, named ViBERTgrid. Unlike BERTgrid, the parameters of BERT and CNN in our multimodal backbone network are trained jointly. Our experimental results demonstrate that this joint training strategy improves significantly the representation ability of ViBERTgrid. Consequently, our ViBERTgrid-based key information extraction approach has achieved state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[10] Title: Theory and Evaluation Metrics for Learning Disentangled Representations Abstract: We make two theoretical contributions to disentanglement learning by (a) defining precise semantics of disentangled representations, and (b) establishing robust metrics for evaluation. First, we characterize the concept \"disentangled representations\" used in supervised and unsupervised methods along three dimensions-informativeness, separability and interpretability - which can be expressed and quantified explicitly using information-theoretic constructs. This helps explain the behaviors of several well-known disentanglement learning models. We then propose robust metrics for measuring informativeness, separability and interpretability. Through a comprehensive suite of experiments, we show that our metrics correctly characterize the representations learned by different methods and are consistent with qualitative (visual) results. Thus, the metrics allow disentanglement learning methods to be compared on a fair ground. We also empirically uncovered new interesting properties of VAE-based methods and interpreted them with our formulation. These findings are promising and hopefully will encourage the design of more theoretically driven models for learning disentangled representations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[11] Title: Robustly Disentangled Causal Mechanisms: Validating Deep Representations for Interventional Robustness Abstract: The ability to learn disentangled representations that split underlying sources of variation in high dimensional, unstructured data is important for data efficient and robust use of neural networks. While various approaches aiming towards this goal have been proposed in recent times, a commonly accepted definition and validation procedure is missing. We provide a causal perspective on representation learning which covers disentanglement and domain shift robustness as special cases. Our causal framework allows us to introduce a new metric for the quantitative evaluation of deep latent variable models. We show how this metric can be estimated from labeled observational data and further provide an efficient estimation algorithm that scales linearly in the dataset size.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[12] Title: Face Identity Disentanglement via Latent Space Mapping Abstract: Learning disentangled representations of data is a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence. Specifically, disentangled latent representations allow generative models to control and compose the disentangled factors in the synthesis process. Current methods, however, require extensive supervision and training, or instead, noticeably compromise quality. In this paper, we present a method that learns how to represent data in a disentangled way, with minimal supervision, manifested solely using available pre-trained networks. Our key insight is to decouple the processes of disentanglement and synthesis, by employing a leading pre-trained unconditional image generator, such as StyleGAN. By learning to map into its latent space, we leverage both its state-of-the-art quality, and its rich and expressive latent space, without the burden of training it. We demonstrate our approach on the complex and high dimensional domain of human heads. We evaluate our method qualitatively and quantitatively, and exhibit its success with de-identification operations and with temporal identity coherency in image sequences. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our method successfully disentangles identity from other facial attributes, surpassing existing methods, even though they require more training and supervision.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[13] Title: Towards a Definition of Disentangled Representations Abstract: How can intelligent agents solve a diverse set of tasks in a data-efficient manner? The disentangled representation learning approach posits that such an agent would benefit from separating out (disentangling) the underlying structure of the world into disjoint parts of its representation. However, there is no generally agreed-upon definition of disentangling, not least because it is unclear how to formalise the notion of world structure beyond toy datasets with a known ground truth generative process. Here we propose that a principled solution to characterising disentangled representations can be found by focusing on the transformation properties of the world. In particular, we suggest that those transformations that change only some properties of the underlying world state, while leaving all other properties invariant, are what gives exploitable structure to any kind of data. Similar ideas have already been successfully applied in physics, where the study of symmetry transformations has revolutionised the understanding of the world structure. By connecting symmetry transformations to vector representations using the formalism of group and representation theory we arrive at the first formal definition of disentangled representations. Our new definition is in agreement with many of the current intuitions about disentangling, while also providing principled resolutions to a number of previous points of contention. While this work focuses on formally defining disentangling - as opposed to solving the learning problem - we believe that the shift in perspective to studying data transformations can stimulate the development of better representation learning algorithms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[14] Title: Self-Attentive Document Interaction Networks for Permutation Equivariant Ranking Abstract: How to leverage cross-document interactions to improve ranking performance is an important topic in information retrieval (IR) research. However, this topic has not been well-studied in the learning-to-rank setting and most of the existing work still treats each document independently while scoring. The recent development of deep learning shows strength in modeling complex relationships across sequences and sets. It thus motivates us to study how to leverage cross-document interactions for learning-to-rank in the deep learning framework. In this paper, we formally define the permutation-equivariance requirement for a scoring function that captures cross-document interactions. We then propose a self-attention based document interaction network and show that it satisfies the permutation-equivariant requirement, and can generate scores for document sets of varying sizes. Our proposed methods can automatically learn to capture document interactions without any auxiliary information, and can scale across large document sets. We conduct experiments on three ranking datasets: the benchmark Web30k, a Gmail search, and a Google Drive Quick Access dataset. Experimental results show that our proposed methods are both more effective and efficient than baselines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[15] Title: Commutative Lie Group VAE for Disentanglement Learning Abstract: We view disentanglement learning as discovering an underlying structure that equivariantly reflects the factorized variations shown in data. Traditionally, such a structure is fixed to be a vector space with data variations represented by translations along individual latent dimensions. We argue this simple structure is suboptimal since it requires the model to learn to discard the properties (e.g. different scales of changes, different levels of abstractness) of data variations, which is an extra work than equivariance learning. Instead, we propose to encode the data variations with groups, a structure not only can equivariantly represent variations, but can also be adaptively optimized to preserve the properties of data variations. Considering it is hard to conduct training on group structures, we focus on Lie groups and adopt a parameterization using Lie algebra. Based on the parameterization, some disentanglement learning constraints are naturally derived. A simple model named Commutative Lie Group VAE is introduced to realize the group-based disentanglement learning. Experiments show that our model can effectively learn disentangled representations without supervision, and can achieve state-of-the-art performance without extra constraints.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[16] Title: Disentangling by Factorising Abstract: We define and address the problem of unsupervised learning of disentangled representations on data generated from independent factors of variation. We propose FactorVAE, a method that disentangles by encouraging the distribution of representations to be factorial and hence independent across the dimensions. We show that it improves upon $\\\\beta$-VAE by providing a better trade-off between disentanglement and reconstruction quality. Moreover, we highlight the problems of a commonly used disentanglement metric and introduce a new metric that does not suffer from them.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[17] Title: Representation Disentanglement for Multi-task Learning with application to Fetal Ultrasound Abstract: One of the biggest challenges for deep learning algorithms in medical image analysis is the indiscriminate mixing of image properties, e.g. artifacts and anatomy. These entangled image properties lead to a semantically redundant feature encoding for the relevant task and thus lead to poor generalization of deep learning algorithms. In this paper we propose a novel representation disentanglement method to extract semantically meaningful and generalizable features for different tasks within a multi-task learning framework. Deep neural networks are utilized to ensure that the encoded features are maximally informative with respect to relevant tasks, while an adversarial regularization encourages these features to be disentangled and minimally informative about irrelevant tasks. We aim to use the disentangled representations to generalize the applicability of deep neural networks. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method on synthetic data as well as fetal ultrasound images. Our experiments illustrate that our method is capable of learning disentangled internal representations. It outperforms baseline methods in multiple tasks, especially on images with new properties, e.g. previously unseen artifacts in fetal ultrasound.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[18] Title: Yes We Care! -- Certification for Machine Learning Methods through the Care Label Framework Abstract: Machine learning applications have become ubiquitous. Their applications range from embedded control in production machines over process optimization in diverse areas (e.g., traffic, finance, sciences) to direct user interactions like advertising and recommendations. This has led to an increased effort of making machine learning trustworthy. Explainable and fair AI have already matured. They address the knowledgeable user and the application engineer. However, there are users that want to deploy a learned model in a similar way as their washing machine. These stakeholders do not want to spend time in understanding the model, but want to rely on guaranteed properties. What are the relevant properties? How can they be expressed to the stakeholder without presupposing machine learning knowledge? How can they be guaranteed for a certain implementation of a machine learning model? These questions move far beyond the current state of the art and we want to address them here. We propose a unified framework that certifies learning methods via care labels. They are easy to understand and draw inspiration from well-known certificates like textile labels or property cards of electronic devices. Our framework considers both, the machine learning theory and a given implementation. We test the implementation\\'s compliance with theoretical properties and bounds.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[19] Title: A Comparative Study on Different Types of Approaches to Bengali document Categorization Abstract: Document categorization is a technique where the category of a document is determined. In this paper three well-known supervised learning techniques which are Support Vector Machine(SVM), Na\\\\\"ive Bayes(NB) and Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) compared for Bengali document categorization. Besides classifier, classification also depends on how feature is selected from dataset. For analyzing those classifier performances on predicting a document against twelve categories several feature selection techniques are also applied in this article namely Chi square distribution, normalized TFIDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) with word analyzer. So, we attempt to explore the efficiency of those three-classification algorithms by using two different feature selection techniques in this article.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[20] Title: Graph-based Deep Generative Modelling for Document Layout Generation Abstract: One of the major prerequisites for any deep learning approach is the availability of large-scale training data. When dealing with scanned document images in real world scenarios, the principal information of its content is stored in the layout itself. In this work, we have proposed an automated deep generative model using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate synthetic data with highly variable and plausible document layouts that can be used to train document interpretation systems, in this case, specially in digital mailroom applications. It is also the first graph-based approach for document layout generation task experimented on administrative document images, in this case, invoices.\\n\\nYour ranking (most to least relevant):<end_of_turn>\\n<start_of_turn>model\\n[5] > [8] > [18] > [2] > [20] > [1] > [3] > [4] > [6] > [7] > [9] > [10] > [11] > [12] > [13] > [14] > [15] > [16] > [17] > [19]<end_of_turn>\\n'"

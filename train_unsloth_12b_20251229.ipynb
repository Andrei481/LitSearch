       "'Title: How do lexical semantics affect translation? An empirical study\\nAbstract: Neural machine translation (NMT) systems aim to map text from one language\\ninto another. While there are a wide variety of applications of NMT, one of the\\nmost important is translation of natural language. A distinguishing factor of\\nnatural language is that words are typically ordered according to the rules of\\nthe grammar of a given language. Although many advances have been made in\\ndeveloping NMT systems for translating natural language, little research has\\nbeen done on understanding how the word ordering of and lexical similarity\\nbetween the source and target language affect translation performance. Here, we\\ninvestigate these relationships on a variety of low-resource language pairs\\nfrom the OpenSubtitles2016 database, where the source language is English, and\\nfind that the more similar the target language is to English, the greater the\\ntranslation performance. In addition, we study the impact of providing NMT\\nmodels with part of speech of words (POS) in the English sequence and find\\nthat, for Transformer-based models, the more dissimilar the target language is\\nfrom English, the greater the benefit provided by POS.'"

In this paper, we study importance labeling problem, in which we are given many unlabeled data and select a limited number of data to be labeled from the unlabeled data, and then a learning algorithm is executed on the selected one. We propose a new importance labeling scheme that can effectively select an informative subset of unlabeled data in least squares regression in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). We analyze the generalization error of gradient descent combined with our labeling scheme and show that the proposed algorithm achieves the optimal rate of convergence in much wider settings and especially gives much better generalization ability in a small label noise setting than the usual uniform sampling scheme. Numerical experiments verify our theoretical findings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[3] Title: Evaluating Predictive Uncertainty and Robustness to Distributional Shift Using Real World Data Abstract: Most machine learning models operate under the assumption that the training, testing and deployment data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This assumption doesn\\'t generally hold true in a natural setting. Usually, the deployment data is subject to various types of distributional shifts. The magnitude of a model\\'s performance is proportional to this shift in the distribution of the dataset. Thus it becomes necessary to evaluate a model\\'s uncertainty and robustness to distributional shifts to get a realistic estimate of its expected performance on real-world data. Present methods to evaluate uncertainty and model\\'s robustness are lacking and often fail to paint the full picture. Moreover, most analysis so far has primarily focused on classification tasks. In this paper, we propose more insightful metrics for general regression tasks using the Shifts Weather Prediction Dataset. We also present an evaluation of the baseline methods using these metrics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[4] Title: Image Classification with Deep Learning in the Presence of Noisy Labels: A Survey Abstract: Image classification systems recently made a giant leap with the advancement of deep neural networks. However, these systems require an excessive amount of labeled data to be adequately trained. Gathering a correctly annotated dataset is not always feasible due to several factors, such as the expensiveness of the labeling process or difficulty of correctly classifying data, even for the experts. Because of these practical challenges, label noise is a common problem in real-world datasets, and numerous methods to train deep neural networks with label noise are proposed in the literature. Although deep neural networks are known to be relatively robust to label noise, their tendency to overfit data makes them vulnerable to memorizing even random noise. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the existence of label noise and develop counter algorithms to fade away its adverse effects to train deep neural networks efficiently. Even though an extensive survey of machine learning techniques under label noise exists, the literature lacks a comprehensive survey of methodologies centered explicitly around deep learning in the presence of noisy labels. This paper aims to present these algorithms while categorizing them into one of the two subgroups: noise model based and noise model free methods. Algorithms in the first group aim to estimate the noise structure and use this information to avoid the adverse effects of noisy labels. Differently, methods in the second group try to come up with inherently noise robust algorithms by using approaches like robust losses, regularizers or other learning paradigms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[5] Title: Combining Crowd and Machines for Multi-predicate Item Screening Abstract: This paper discusses how crowd and machine classifiers can be efficiently combined to screen items that satisfy a set of predicates. We show that this is a recurring problem in many domains, present machine-human (hybrid) algorithms that screen items efficiently and estimate the gain over human-only or machine-only screening in terms of performance and cost. We further show how, given a new classification problem and a set of classifiers of unknown accuracy for the problem at hand, we can identify how to manage the cost-accuracy trade off by progressively determining if we should spend budget to obtain test data (to assess the accuracy of the given classifiers), or to train an ensemble of classifiers, or whether we should leverage the existing machine classifiers with the crowd, and in this case how to efficiently combine them based on their estimated characteristics to obtain the classification. We demonstrate that the techniques we propose obtain significant cost/accuracy improvements with respect to the leading classification algorithms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[6] Title: Sequential Neural Processes Abstract: Neural Processes combine the strengths of neural networks and Gaussian processes to achieve both flexible learning and fast prediction in stochastic processes. However, a large class of problems comprises underlying temporal dependency structures in a sequence of stochastic processes that Neural Processes (NP) do not explicitly consider. In this paper, we propose Sequential Neural Processes (SNP) which incorporates a temporal state-transition model of stochastic processes and thus extends its modeling capabilities to dynamic stochastic processes. In applying SNP to dynamic 3D scene modeling, we introduce the Temporal Generative Query Networks. To our knowledge, this is the first 4D model that can deal with the temporal dynamics of 3D scenes. In experiments, we evaluate the proposed methods in dynamic (non-stationary) regression and 4D scene inference and rendering.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[7] Title: Bounded Expectation of Label Assignment: Dataset Annotation by Supervised Splitting with Bias-Reduction Techniques Abstract: Annotating large unlabeled datasets can be a major bottleneck for machine learning applications. We introduce a scheme for inferring labels of unlabeled data at a fraction of the cost of labeling the entire dataset. Our scheme, bounded expectation of label assignment (BELA), greedily queries an oracle (or human labeler) and partitions a dataset to find data subsets that have mostly the same label. BELA can then infer labels by majority vote of the known labels in each subset. BELA determines whether to split or label from a subset by maximizing a lower bound on the expected number of correctly labeled examples. Our approach differs from existing hierarchical labeling schemes by using supervised models to partition the data, therefore avoiding reliance on unsupervised clustering methods that may not accurately group data by label. We design BELA with strategies to avoid bias that could be introduced through this adaptive partitioning. We evaluate BELA on three datasets and find that it outperforms existing strategies for adaptive labeling.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[8] Title: An Empirical Study on the Intrinsic Privacy of SGD Abstract: Introducing noise in the training of machine learning systems is a powerful way to protect individual privacy via differential privacy guarantees, but comes at a cost to utility. This work looks at whether the inherent randomness of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) could contribute to privacy, effectively reducing the amount of \\\\emph{additional} noise required to achieve a given privacy guarantee. We conduct a large-scale empirical study to examine this question. Training a grid of over 120,000 models across four datasets (tabular and images) on convex and non-convex objectives, we demonstrate that the random seed has a larger impact on model weights than any individual training example. We test the distribution over weights induced by the seed, finding that the simple convex case can be modelled with a multivariate Gaussian posterior, while neural networks exhibit multi-modal and non-Gaussian weight distributions. By casting convex SGD as a Gaussian mechanism, we then estimate an `intrinsic\\' data-dependent $\\\\epsilon_i(\\\\mathcal{D})$, finding values as low as 6.3, dropping to 1.9 using empirical estimates. We use a membership inference attack to estimate $\\\\epsilon$ for non-convex SGD and demonstrate that hiding the random seed from the adversary results in a statistically significant reduction in attack performance, corresponding to a reduction in the effective $\\\\epsilon$. These results provide empirical evidence that SGD exhibits appreciable variability relative to its dataset sensitivity, and this `intrinsic noise\\' has the potential to be leveraged to improve the utility of privacy-preserving machine learning.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[9] Title: Coupling the reduced-order model and the generative model for an importance sampling estimator Abstract: In this work, we develop an importance sampling estimator by coupling the reduced-order model and the generative model in a problem setting of uncertainty quantification. The target is to estimate the probability that the quantity of interest (QoI) in a complex system is beyond a given threshold. To avoid the prohibitive cost of sampling a large scale system, the reduced-order model is usually considered for a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. However, the Monte Carlo estimator given by the reduced-order model is biased due to the error from dimension reduction. To correct the bias, we still need to sample the fine model. An effective technique to reduce the variance reduction is importance sampling, where we employ the generative model to estimate the distribution of the data from the reduced-order model and use it for the change of measure in the importance sampling estimator. To compensate the approximation errors of the reduced-order model, more data that induce a slightly smaller QoI than the threshold need to be included into the training set. Although the amount of these data can be controlled by a posterior error estimate, redundant data, which may outnumber the effective data, will be kept due to the epistemic uncertainty. To deal with this issue, we introduce a weighted empirical distribution to process the data from the reduced-order model. The generative model is then trained by minimizing the cross entropy between it and the weighted empirical distribution. We also introduce a penalty term into the objective function to deal with the overfitting for more robustness. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[10] Title: Guided Labeling using Convolutional Neural Networks Abstract: Over the last couple of years, deep learning and especially convolutional neural networks have become one of the work horses of computer vision. One limiting factor for the applicability of supervised deep learning to more areas is the need for large, manually labeled datasets. In this paper we propose an easy to implement method we call guided labeling, which automatically determines which samples from an unlabeled dataset should be labeled. We show that using this procedure, the amount of samples that need to be labeled is reduced considerably in comparison to labeling images arbitrarily.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[11] Title: An interpretable semi-supervised classifier using two different strategies for amended self-labeling Abstract: In the context of some machine learning applications, obtaining data instances is a relatively easy process but labeling them could become quite expensive or tedious. Such scenarios lead to datasets with few labeled instances and a larger number of unlabeled ones. Semi-supervised classification techniques combine labeled and unlabeled data during the learning phase in order to increase the classifier\\'s generalization capability. Regrettably, most successful semi-supervised classifiers do not allow explaining their outcome, thus behaving like black boxes. However, there is an increasing number of problem domains in which experts demand a clear understanding of the decision process. In this paper, we report on an extended experimental study presenting an interpretable self-labeling grey-box classifier that uses a black box to estimate the missing class labels and a white box to explain the final predictions. Two different approaches for amending the self-labeling process are explored: a first one based on the confidence of the black box and the latter one based on measures from Rough Set Theory. The results of the extended experimental study support the interpretability by means of transparency and simplicity of our classifier, while attaining superior prediction rates when compared with state-of-the-art self-labeling classifiers reported in the literature.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[12] Title: Content-based similar document image retrieval using fusion of CNN features Abstract: Rapid increase of digitized document give birth to high demand of document image retrieval. While conventional document image retrieval approaches depend on complex OCR-based text recognition and text similarity detection, this paper proposes a new content-based approach, in which more attention is paid to features extraction and fusion. In the proposed approach, multiple features of document images are extracted by different CNN models. After that, the extracted CNN features are reduced and fused into weighted average feature. Finally, the document images are ranked based on feature similarity to a provided query image. Experimental procedure is performed on a group of document images that transformed from academic papers, which contain both English and Chinese document, the results show that the proposed approach has good ability to retrieve document images with similar text content, and the fusion of CNN features can effectively improve the retrieval accuracy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[13] Title: Cost-Sensitive Feature-Value Acquisition Using Feature Relevance Abstract: In many real-world machine learning problems, feature values are not readily available. To make predictions, some of the missing features have to be acquired, which can incur a cost in money, computational time, or human time, depending on the problem domain. This leads us to the problem of choosing which features to use at the prediction time. The chosen features should increase the prediction accuracy for a low cost, but determining which features will do that is challenging. The choice should take into account the previously acquired feature values as well as the feature costs. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this problem. The proposed approach chooses the most useful features adaptively based on how relevant they are for the prediction task as well as what the corresponding feature costs are. Our approach uses a generic neural network architecture, which is suitable for a wide range of problems. We evaluate our approach on three cost-sensitive datasets, including Yahoo! Learning to Rank Competition dataset as well as two health datasets. We show that our approach achieves high accuracy with a lower cost than the current state-of-the-art approaches.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[14] Title: Forward Thinking: Building Deep Random Forests Abstract: The success of deep neural networks has inspired many to wonder whether other learners could benefit from deep, layered architectures. We present a general framework called forward thinking for deep learning that generalizes the architectural flexibility and sophistication of deep neural networks while also allowing for (i) different types of learning functions in the network, other than neurons, and (ii) the ability to adaptively deepen the network as needed to improve results. This is done by training one layer at a time, and once a layer is trained, the input data are mapped forward through the layer to create a new learning problem. The process is then repeated, transforming the data through multiple layers, one at a time, rendering a new dataset, which is expected to be better behaved, and on which a final output layer can achieve good performance. In the case where the neurons of deep neural nets are replaced with decision trees, we call the result a Forward Thinking Deep Random Forest (FTDRF). We demonstrate a proof of concept by applying FTDRF on the MNIST dataset. We also provide a general mathematical formulation that allows for other types of deep learning problems to be considered.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[15] Title: Bridging the Gap: Machine Learning to Resolve Improperly Modeled Dynamics Abstract: We present a data-driven modeling strategy to overcome improperly modeled dynamics for systems exhibiting complex spatio-temporal behaviors. We propose a Deep Learning framework to resolve the differences between the true dynamics of the system and the dynamics given by a model of the system that is either inaccurately or inadequately described. Our machine learning strategy leverages data generated from the improper system model and observational data from the actual system to create a neural network to model the dynamics of the actual system. We evaluate the proposed framework using numerical solutions obtained from three increasingly complex dynamical systems. Our results show that our system is capable of learning a data-driven model that provides accurate estimates of the system states both in previously unobserved regions as well as for future states. Our results show the power of state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks in estimating an accurate prior of the system\\'s true dynamics that can be used for prediction up to a finite horizon.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[16] Title: Modelling and Quantifying Membership Information Leakage in Machine Learning Abstract: Machine learning models have been shown to be vulnerable to membership inference attacks, i.e., inferring whether individuals\\' data have been used for training models. The lack of understanding about factors contributing success of these attacks motivates the need for modelling membership information leakage using information theory and for investigating properties of machine learning models and training algorithms that can reduce membership information leakage. We use conditional mutual information leakage to measure the amount of information leakage from the trained machine learning model about the presence of an individual in the training dataset. We devise an upper bound for this measure of information leakage using Kullback--Leibler divergence that is more amenable to numerical computation. We prove a direct relationship between the Kullback--Leibler membership information leakage and the probability of success for a hypothesis-testing adversary examining whether a particular data record belongs to the training dataset of a machine learning model. We show that the mutual information leakage is a decreasing function of the training dataset size and the regularization weight. We also prove that, if the sensitivity of the machine learning model (defined in terms of the derivatives of the fitness with respect to model parameters) is high, more membership information is potentially leaked. This illustrates that complex models, such as deep neural networks, are more susceptible to membership inference attacks in comparison to simpler models with fewer degrees of freedom. We show that the amount of the membership information leakage is reduced by $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log^{1/2}(\\\\delta^{-1})\\\\epsilon^{-1})$ when using Gaussian $(\\\\epsilon,\\\\delta)$-differentially-private additive noises.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[17] Title: Anomaly Detection Under Controlled Sensing Using Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning Abstract: We consider the problem of detecting anomalies among a given set of processes using their noisy binary sensor measurements. The noiseless sensor measurement corresponding to a normal process is 0, and the measurement is 1 if the process is anomalous. The decision-making algorithm is assumed to have no knowledge of the number of anomalous processes. The algorithm is allowed to choose a subset of the sensors at each time instant until the confidence level on the decision exceeds the desired value. Our objective is to design a sequential sensor selection policy that dynamically determines which processes to observe at each time and when to terminate the detection algorithm. The selection policy is designed such that the anomalous processes are detected with the desired confidence level while incurring minimum cost which comprises the delay in detection and the cost of sensing. We cast this problem as a sequential hypothesis testing problem within the framework of Markov decision processes, and solve it using the actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm. This deep neural network-based algorithm offers a low complexity solution with good detection accuracy. We also study the effect of statistical dependence between the processes on the algorithm performance. Through numerical experiments, we show that our algorithm is able to adapt to any unknown statistical dependence pattern of the processes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[18] Title: Data Collection and Quality Challenges in Deep Learning: A Data-Centric AI Perspective Abstract: Data-centric AI is at the center of a fundamental shift in software engineering where machine learning becomes the new software, powered by big data and computing infrastructure. Here software engineering needs to be re-thought where data becomes a first-class citizen on par with code. One striking observation is that a significant portion of the machine learning process is spent on data preparation. Without good data, even the best machine learning algorithms cannot perform well. As a result, data-centric AI practices are now becoming mainstream. Unfortunately, many datasets in the real world are small, dirty, biased, and even poisoned. In this survey, we study the research landscape for data collection and data quality primarily for deep learning applications. Data collection is important because there is lesser need for feature engineering for recent deep learning approaches, but instead more need for large amounts of data. For data quality, we study data validation, cleaning, and integration techniques. Even if the data cannot be fully cleaned, we can still cope with imperfect data during model training using robust model training techniques. In addition, while bias and fairness have been less studied in traditional data management research, these issues become essential topics in modern machine learning applications. We thus study fairness measures and unfairness mitigation techniques that can be applied before, during, or after model training. We believe that the data management community is well poised to solve these problems.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[19] Title: Time-Sensitive Bayesian Information Aggregation for Crowdsourcing Systems Abstract: Crowdsourcing systems commonly face the problem of aggregating multiple judgments provided by potentially unreliable workers. In addition, several aspects of the design of efficient crowdsourcing processes, such as defining worker\\'s bonuses, fair prices and time limits of the tasks, involve knowledge of the likely duration of the task at hand. Bringing this together, in this work we introduce a new time--sensitive Bayesian aggregation method that simultaneously estimates a task\\'s duration and obtains reliable aggregations of crowdsourced judgments. Our method, called BCCTime, builds on the key insight that the time taken by a worker to perform a task is an important indicator of the likely quality of the produced judgment. To capture this, BCCTime uses latent variables to represent the uncertainty about the workers\\' completion time, the tasks\\' duration and the workers\\' accuracy. To relate the quality of a judgment to the time a worker spends on a task, our model assumes that each task is completed within a latent time window within which all workers with a propensity to genuinely attempt the labelling task (i.e., no spammers) are expected to submit their judgments. In contrast, workers with a lower propensity to valid labeling, such as spammers, bots or lazy labelers, are assumed to perform tasks considerably faster or slower than the time required by normal workers. Specifically, we use efficient message-passing Bayesian inference to learn approximate posterior probabilities of (i) the confusion matrix of each worker, (ii) the propensity to valid labeling of each worker, (iii) the unbiased duration of each task and (iv) the true label of each task. Using two real-world public datasets for entity linking tasks, we show that BCCTime produces up to 11% more accurate classifications and up to 100% more informative estimates of a task\\'s duration\\n\\n---\\n\\n[20] Title: Enabling Smart Data: Noise filtering in Big Data classification Abstract: In any knowledge discovery process the value of extracted knowledge is directly related to the quality of the data used. Big Data problems, generated by massive growth in the scale of data observed in recent years, also follow the same dictate. A common problem affecting data quality is the presence of noise, particularly in classification problems, where label noise refers to the incorrect labeling of training instances, and is known to be a very disruptive feature of data. However, in this Big Data era, the massive growth in the scale of the data poses a challenge to traditional proposals created to tackle noise, as they have difficulties coping with such a large amount of data. New algorithms need to be proposed to treat the noise in Big Data problems, providing high quality and clean data, also known as Smart Data. In this paper, two Big Data preprocessing approaches to remove noisy examples are proposed: an homogeneous ensemble and an heterogeneous ensemble filter, with special emphasis in their scalability and performance traits. The obtained results show that these proposals enable the practitioner to efficiently obtain a Smart Dataset from any Big Data classification problem.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[21] Title: DISCO: Influence Maximization Meets Network Embedding and Deep Learning Abstract: Since its introduction in 2003, the influence maximization (IM) problem has drawn significant research attention in the literature. The aim of IM is to select a set of k users who can influence the most individuals in the social network. The problem is proven to be NP-hard. A large number of approximate algorithms have been proposed to address this problem. The state-of-the-art algorithms estimate the expected influence of nodes based on sampled diffusion paths. As the number of required samples have been recently proven to be lower bounded by a particular threshold that presets tradeoff between the accuracy and efficiency, the result quality of these traditional solutions is hard to be further improved without sacrificing efficiency. In this paper, we present an orthogonal and novel paradigm to address the IM problem by leveraging deep learning models to estimate the expected influence. Specifically, we present a novel framework called DISCO that incorporates network embedding and deep reinforcement learning techniques to address this problem. Experimental study on real-world networks demonstrates that DISCO achieves the best performance w.r.t efficiency and influence spread quality compared to state-of-the-art classical solutions. Besides, we also show that the learning model exhibits good generality.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[22] Title: Privacy-preserving Machine Learning through Data Obfuscation Abstract: As machine learning becomes a practice and commodity, numerous cloud-based services and frameworks are provided to help customers develop and deploy machine learning applications. While it is prevalent to outsource model training and serving tasks in the cloud, it is important to protect the privacy of sensitive samples in the training dataset and prevent information leakage to untrusted third parties. Past work have shown that a malicious machine learning service provider or end user can easily extract critical information about the training samples, from the model parameters or even just model outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic methodology to preserve the privacy of training data in machine learning applications. Specifically we introduce an obfuscate function and apply it to the training data before feeding them to the model training task. This function adds random noise to existing samples, or augments the dataset with new samples. By doing so sensitive information about the properties of individual samples, or statistical properties of a group of samples, is hidden. Meanwhile the model trained from the obfuscated dataset can still achieve high accuracy. With this approach, the customers can safely disclose the data or models to third-party providers or end users without the need to worry about data privacy. Our experiments show that this approach can effective defeat four existing types of machine learning privacy attacks at negligible accuracy cost.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[23] Title: A deep active learning system for species identification and counting in camera trap images Abstract: Biodiversity conservation depends on accurate, up-to-date information about wildlife population distributions. Motion-activated cameras, also known as camera traps, are a critical tool for population surveys, as they are cheap and non-intrusive. However, extracting useful information from camera trap images is a cumbersome process: a typical camera trap survey may produce millions of images that require slow, expensive manual review. Consequently, critical information is often lost due to resource limitations, and critical conservation questions may be answered too slowly to support decision-making. Computer vision is poised to dramatically increase efficiency in image-based biodiversity surveys, and recent studies have harnessed deep learning techniques for automatic information extraction from camera trap images. However, the accuracy of results depends on the amount, quality, and diversity of the data available to train models, and the literature has focused on projects with millions of relevant, labeled training images. Many camera trap projects do not have a large set of labeled images and hence cannot benefit from existing machine learning techniques. Furthermore, even projects that do have labeled data from similar ecosystems have struggled to adopt deep learning methods because image classification models overfit to specific image backgrounds (i.e., camera locations). In this paper, we focus not on automating the labeling of camera trap images, but on accelerating this process. We combine the power of machine intelligence and human intelligence to build a scalable, fast, and accurate active learning system to minimize the manual work required to identify and count animals in camera trap images. Our proposed scheme can match the state of the art accuracy on a 3.2 million image dataset with as few as 14,100 manual labels, which means decreasing manual labeling effort by over 99.5%.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[24] Title: Robust Triple-Matrix-Recovery-Based Auto-Weighted Label Propagation for Classification Abstract: The graph-based semi-supervised label propagation algorithm has delivered impressive classification results. However, the estimated soft labels typically contain mixed signs and noise, which cause inaccurate predictions due to the lack of suitable constraints. Moreover, available methods typically calculate the weights and estimate the labels in the original input space, which typically contains noise and corruption. Thus, the en-coded similarities and manifold smoothness may be inaccurate for label estimation. In this paper, we present effective schemes for resolving these issues and propose a novel and robust semi-supervised classification algorithm, namely, the tri-ple-matrix-recovery-based robust auto-weighted label propa-gation framework (ALP-TMR). Our ALP-TMR introduces a triple matrix recovery mechanism to remove noise or mixed signs from the estimated soft labels and improve the robustness to noise and outliers in the steps of assigning weights and pre-dicting the labels simultaneously. Our method can jointly re-cover the underlying clean data, clean labels and clean weighting spaces by decomposing the original data, predicted soft labels or weights into a clean part plus an error part by fitting noise. In addition, ALP-TMR integrates the au-to-weighting process by minimizing reconstruction errors over the recovered clean data and clean soft labels, which can en-code the weights more accurately to improve both data rep-resentation and classification. By classifying samples in the recovered clean label and weight spaces, one can potentially improve the label prediction results. The results of extensive experiments demonstrated the satisfactory performance of our ALP-TMR.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[25] Title: A Unified Generative Adversarial Network Training via Self-Labeling and Self-Attention Abstract: We propose a novel GAN training scheme that can handle any level of labeling in a unified manner. Our scheme introduces a form of artificial labeling that can incorporate manually defined labels, when available, and induce an alignment between them. To define the artificial labels, we exploit the assumption that neural network generators can be trained more easily to map nearby latent vectors to data with semantic similarities, than across separate categories. We use generated data samples and their corresponding artificial conditioning labels to train a classifier. The classifier is then used to self-label real data. To boost the accuracy of the self-labeling, we also use the exponential moving average of the classifier. However, because the classifier might still make mistakes, especially at the beginning of the training, we also refine the labels through self-attention, by using the labeling of real data samples only when the classifier outputs a high classification probability score. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, STL-10 and SVHN, and show that both self-labeling and self-attention consistently improve the quality of generated data. More surprisingly, we find that the proposed scheme can even outperform class-conditional GANs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[26] Title: LeagueAI: Improving object detector performance and flexibility through automatically generated training data and domain randomization Abstract: In this technical report I present my method for automatic synthetic dataset generation for object detection and demonstrate it on the video game League of Legends. This report furthermore serves as a handbook on how to automatically generate datasets and as an introduction on the dataset generation part of the LeagueAI framework. The LeagueAI framework is a software framework that provides detailed information about the game League of Legends based on the same input a human player would have, namely vision. The framework allows researchers and enthusiasts to develop their own intelligent agents or to extract detailed information about the state of the game. A big problem of machine vision applications usually is the laborious work of gathering large amounts of hand labeled data. Thus, a crucial part of the vision pipeline of the LeagueAI framework, the dataset generation, is presented in this report. The method involves extracting image raw data from the game\\'s 3D models and combining them with the game background to create game-like synthetic images and to generate the corresponding labels automatically. In an experiment I compared a model trained on synthetic data to a model trained on hand labeled data and a model trained on a combined dataset. The model trained on the synthetic data showed higher detection precision on more classes and more reliable tracking performance of the player character. The model trained on the combined dataset did not perform better because of the different formats of the older hand labeled dataset and the synthetic data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[27] Title: Data Programming using Continuous and Quality-Guided Labeling Functions Abstract: Scarcity of labeled data is a bottleneck for supervised learning models. A paradigm that has evolved for dealing with this problem is data programming. An existing data programming paradigm allows human supervision to be provided as a set of discrete labeling functions (LF) that output possibly noisy labels to input instances and a generative modelfor consolidating the weak labels. We enhance and generalize this paradigm by supporting functions that output a continuous score (instead of a hard label) that noisily correlates with labels. We show across five applications that continuous LFs are more natural to program and lead to improved recall. We also show that accuracy of existing generative models is unstable with respect to initialization, training epochs, and learning rates. We give control to the data programmer to guide the training process by providing intuitive quality guides with each LF. We propose an elegant method of incorporating these guides into the generative model. Our overall method, called CAGE, makes the data programming paradigm more reliable than other tricks based on initialization, sign-penalties, or soft-accuracy constraints.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[28] Title: Jasmine: A New Active Learning Approach to Combat Cybercrime Abstract: Over the past decade, the advent of cybercrime has accelarated the research on cybersecurity. However, the deployment of intrusion detection methods falls short. One of the reasons for this is the lack of realistic evaluation datasets, which makes it a challenge to develop techniques and compare them. This is caused by the large amounts of effort it takes for a cyber analyst to classify network connections. This has raised the need for methods (i) that can learn from small sets of labeled data, (ii) that can make predictions on large sets of unlabeled data, and (iii) that request the label of only specially selected unlabeled data instances. Hence, Active Learning (AL) methods are of interest. These approaches choose specific unlabeled instances by a query function that are expected to improve overall classification performance. The resulting query observations are labeled by a human expert and added to the labeled set. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid AL method called Jasmine. Firstly, it determines how suitable each observation is for querying, i.e., how likely it is to enhance classification. These properties are the uncertainty score and anomaly score. Secondly, Jasmine introduces dynamic updating. This allows the model to adjust the balance between querying uncertain, anomalous and randomly selected observations. To this end, Jasmine is able to learn the best query strategy during the labeling process. This is in contrast to the other AL methods in cybersecurity that all have static, predetermined query functions. We show that dynamic updating, and therefore Jasmine, is able to consistently obtain good and more robust results than querying only uncertainties, only anomalies or a fixed combination of the two.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[29] Title: What is the Value of Data? On Mathematical Methods for Data Quality Estimation Abstract: Data is one of the most important assets of the information age, and its societal impact is undisputed. Yet, rigorous methods of assessing the quality of data are lacking. In this paper, we propose a formal definition for the quality of a given dataset. We assess a dataset\\'s quality by a quantity we call the expected diameter, which measures the expected disagreement between two randomly chosen hypotheses that explain it, and has recently found applications in active learning. We focus on Boolean hyperplanes, and utilize a collection of Fourier analytic, algebraic, and probabilistic methods to come up with theoretical guarantees and practical solutions for the computation of the expected diameter. We also study the behaviour of the expected diameter on algebraically structured datasets, conduct experiments that validate this notion of quality, and demonstrate the feasibility of our techniques.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[30] Title: Health Indicator Forecasting for Improving Remaining Useful Life Estimation Abstract: Prognostics is concerned with predicting the future health of the equipment and any potential failures. With the advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), data-driven approaches for prognostics that leverage the power of machine learning models are gaining popularity. One of the most important categories of data-driven approaches relies on a predefined or learned health indicator to characterize the equipment condition up to the present time and make inference on how it is likely to evolve in the future. In these approaches, health indicator forecasting that constructs the health indicator curve over the lifespan using partially observed measurements (i.e., health indicator values within an initial period) plays a key role. Existing health indicator forecasting algorithms, such as the functional Empirical Bayesian approach, the regression-based formulation, a naive scenario matching based on the nearest neighbor, have certain limitations. In this paper, we propose a new `generative + scenario matching\\' algorithm for health indicator forecasting. The key idea behind the proposed approach is to first non-parametrically fit the underlying health indicator curve with a continuous Gaussian Process using a sample of run-to-failure health indicator curves. The proposed approach then generates a rich set of random curves from the learned distribution, attempting to obtain all possible variations of the target health condition evolution process over the system\\'s lifespan. The health indicator extrapolation for a piece of functioning equipment is inferred as the generated curve that has the highest matching level within the observed period. Our experimental results show the superiority of our algorithm over the other state-of-the-art methods.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[31] Title: Benchmarking Processor Performance by Multi-Threaded Machine Learning Algorithms Abstract: Machine learning algorithms have enabled computers to predict things by learning from previous data. The data storage and processing power are increasing rapidly, thus increasing machine learning and Artificial intelligence applications. Much of the work is done to improve the accuracy of the models built in the past, with little research done to determine the computational costs of machine learning acquisitions. In this paper, I will proceed with this later research work and will make a performance comparison of multi-threaded machine learning clustering algorithms. I will be working on Linear Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors to determine the performance characteristics of the algorithms as well as the computation costs to the obtained results. I will be benchmarking system hardware performance by running these multi-threaded algorithms to train and test the models on a dataset to note the differences in performance matrices of the algorithms. In the end, I will state the best performing algorithms concerning the performance efficiency of these algorithms on my system.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[32] Title: Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Process Mining: A General Overview and Application of a Novel Local Explanation Approach for Predictive Process Monitoring Abstract: The contemporary process-aware information systems possess the capabilities to record the activities generated during the process execution. To leverage these process specific fine-granular data, process mining has recently emerged as a promising research discipline. As an important branch of process mining, predictive business process management, pursues the objective to generate forward-looking, predictive insights to shape business processes. In this study, we propose a conceptual framework sought to establish and promote understanding of decision-making environment, underlying business processes and nature of the user characteristics for developing explainable business process prediction solutions. Consequently, with regard to the theoretical and practical implications of the framework, this study proposes a novel local post-hoc explanation approach for a deep learning classifier that is expected to facilitate the domain experts in justifying the model decisions. In contrary to alternative popular perturbation-based local explanation approaches, this study defines the local regions from the validation dataset by using the intermediate latent space representations learned by the deep neural networks. To validate the applicability of the proposed explanation method, the real-life process log data delivered by the Volvo IT Belgium\\'s incident management system are used.The adopted deep learning classifier achieves a good performance with the Area Under the ROC Curve of 0.94. The generated local explanations are also visualized and presented with relevant evaluation measures that are expected to increase the users\\' trust in the black-box-model.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[33] Title: Automated Machine Learning: State-of-The-Art and Open Challenges Abstract: With the continuous and vast increase in the amount of data in our digital world, it has been acknowledged that the number of knowledgeable data scientists can not scale to address these challenges. Thus, there was a crucial need for automating the process of building good machine learning models. In the last few years, several techniques and frameworks have been introduced to tackle the challenge of automating the process of Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyper-parameter tuning (CASH) in the machine learning domain. The main aim of these techniques is to reduce the role of the human in the loop and fill the gap for non-expert machine learning users by playing the role of the domain expert. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey for the state-of-the-art efforts in tackling the CASH problem. In addition, we highlight the research work of automating the other steps of the full complex machine learning pipeline (AutoML) from data understanding till model deployment. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive coverage for the various tools and frameworks that have been introduced in this domain. Finally, we discuss some of the research directions and open challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve the vision and goals of the AutoML process.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[34] Title: Label Noise Types and Their Effects on Deep Learning Abstract: The recent success of deep learning is mostly due to the availability of big datasets with clean annotations. However, gathering a cleanly annotated dataset is not always feasible due to practical challenges. As a result, label noise is a common problem in datasets, and numerous methods to train deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels are proposed in the literature. These methods commonly use benchmark datasets with synthetic label noise on the training set. However, there are multiple types of label noise, and each of them has its own characteristic impact on learning. Since each work generates a different kind of label noise, it is problematic to test and compare those algorithms in the literature fairly. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the effects of different kinds of label noise on learning. Moreover, we propose a generic framework to generate feature-dependent label noise, which we show to be the most challenging case for learning. Our proposed method aims to emphasize similarities among data instances by sparsely distributing them in the feature domain. By this approach, samples that are more likely to be mislabeled are detected from their softmax probabilities, and their labels are flipped to the corresponding class. The proposed method can be applied to any clean dataset to synthesize feature-dependent noisy labels. For the ease of other researchers to test their algorithms with noisy labels, we share corrupted labels for the most commonly used benchmark datasets. Our code and generated noisy synthetic labels are available online.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[35] Title: Online Model Selection: a Rested Bandit Formulation Abstract: Motivated by a natural problem in online model selection with bandit information, we introduce and analyze a best arm identification problem in the rested bandit setting, wherein arm expected losses decrease with the number of times the arm has been played. The shape of the expected loss functions is similar across arms, and is assumed to be available up to unknown parameters that have to be learned on the fly. We define a novel notion of regret for this problem, where we compare to the policy that always plays the arm having the smallest expected loss at the end of the game. We analyze an arm elimination algorithm whose regret vanishes as the time horizon increases. The actual rate of convergence depends in a detailed way on the postulated functional form of the expected losses. Unlike known model selection efforts in the recent bandit literature, our algorithm exploits the specific structure of the problem to learn the unknown parameters of the expected loss function so as to identify the best arm as quickly as possible. We complement our analysis with a lower bound, indicating strengths and limitations of the proposed solution.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[36] Title: Convolutional LSTM Neural Networks for Modeling Wildland Fire Dynamics Abstract: As the climate changes, the severity of wildland fires is expected to worsen. Models that accurately capture fire propagation dynamics greatly help efforts for understanding, responding to and mitigating the damages caused by these fires. Machine learning techniques provide a potential approach for developing such models. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) recurrent neural network to model the dynamics of wildland fire propagation. The machine learning model is trained on simulated wildfire data generated by a mathematical analogue model. Three simulated datasets are analyzed, each with increasing degrees of complexity. The simplest dataset includes a constant wind direction as a single confounding factor, whereas the most complex dataset includes dynamic wind, complex terrain, spatially varying moisture content and heterogenous vegetation density distributions. We examine how effective the ConvLSTM can learn the fire-spread dynamics over consecutive time steps. It is shown that ConvLSTMs can capture local fire transmission events, as well as the overall fire dynamics, such as the rate at which the fire spreads. Finally, we demonstrate that ConvLSTMs outperform other network architectures that have previously been used to model similar wildland fire dynamics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[37] Title: Data Troubles in Sentence Level Confidence Estimation for Machine Translation Abstract: The paper investigates the feasibility of confidence estimation for neural machine translation models operating at the high end of the performance spectrum. As a side product of the data annotation process necessary for building such models we propose sentence level accuracy $SACC$ as a simple, self-explanatory evaluation metric for quality of translation. Experiments on two different annotator pools, one comprised of non-expert (crowd-sourced) and one of expert (professional) translators show that $SACC$ can vary greatly depending on the translation proficiency of the annotators, despite the fact that both pools are about equally reliable according to Krippendorff\\'s alpha metric; the relatively low values of inter-annotator agreement confirm the expectation that sentence-level binary labeling $good$ / $needs\\\\ work$ for translation out of context is very hard. For an English-Spanish translation model operating at $SACC = 0.89$ according to a non-expert annotator pool we can derive a confidence estimate that labels 0.5-0.6 of the $good$ translations in an \"in-domain\" test set with 0.95 Precision. Switching to an expert annotator pool decreases $SACC$ dramatically: $0.61$ for English-Spanish, measured on the exact same data as above. This forces us to lower the CE model operating point to 0.9 Precision while labeling correctly about 0.20-0.25 of the $good$ translations in the data. We find surprising the extent to which CE depends on the level of proficiency of the annotator pool used for labeling the data. This leads to an important recommendation we wish to make when tackling CE modeling in practice: it is critical to match the end-user expectation for translation quality in the desired domain with the demands of annotators assigning binary quality labels to CE training data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[38] Title: ICDAR 2021 Competition on Components Segmentation Task of Document Photos Abstract: This paper describes the short-term competition on the Components Segmentation Task of Document Photos that was prepared in the context of the 16th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR 2021). This competition aims to bring together researchers working in the field of identification document image processing and provides them a suitable benchmark to compare their techniques on the component segmentation task of document images. Three challenge tasks were proposed entailing different segmentation assignments to be performed on a provided dataset. The collected data are from several types of Brazilian ID documents, whose personal information was conveniently replaced. There were 16 participants whose results obtained for some or all the three tasks show different rates for the adopted metrics, like Dice Similarity Coefficient ranging from 0.06 to 0.99. Different Deep Learning models were applied by the entrants with diverse strategies to achieve the best results in each of the tasks. Obtained results show that the currently applied methods for solving one of the proposed tasks (document boundary detection) are already well established. However, for the other two challenge tasks (text zone and handwritten sign detection) research and development of more robust approaches are still required to achieve acceptable results.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[39] Title: Efficient sign language recognition system and dataset creation method based on deep learning and image processing Abstract: New deep-learning architectures are created every year, achieving state-of-the-art results in image recognition and leading to the belief that, in a few years, complex tasks such as sign language translation will be considerably easier, serving as a communication tool for the hearing-impaired community. On the other hand, these algorithms still need a lot of data to be trained and the dataset creation process is expensive, time-consuming, and slow. Thereby, this work aims to investigate techniques of digital image processing and machine learning that can be used to create a sign language dataset effectively. We argue about data acquisition, such as the frames per second rate to capture or subsample the videos, the background type, preprocessing, and data augmentation, using convolutional neural networks and object detection to create an image classifier and comparing the results based on statistical tests. Different datasets were created to test the hypotheses, containing 14 words used daily and recorded by different smartphones in the RGB color system. We achieved an accuracy of 96.38% on the test set and 81.36% on the validation set containing more challenging conditions, showing that 30 FPS is the best frame rate subsample to train the classifier, geometric transformations work better than intensity transformations, and artificial background creation is not effective to model generalization. These trade-offs should be considered in future work as a cost-benefit guideline between computational cost and accuracy gain when creating a dataset and training a sign recognition model.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[40] Title: Self-Attentive Document Interaction Networks for Permutation Equivariant Ranking Abstract: How to leverage cross-document interactions to improve ranking performance is an important topic in information retrieval (IR) research. However, this topic has not been well-studied in the learning-to-rank setting and most of the existing work still treats each document independently while scoring. The recent development of deep learning shows strength in modeling complex relationships across sequences and sets. It thus motivates us to study how to leverage cross-document interactions for learning-to-rank in the deep learning framework. In this paper, we formally define the permutation-equivariance requirement for a scoring function that captures cross-document interactions. We then propose a self-attention based document interaction network and show that it satisfies the permutation-equivariant requirement, and can generate scores for document sets of varying sizes. Our proposed methods can automatically learn to capture document interactions without any auxiliary information, and can scale across large document sets. We conduct experiments on three ranking datasets: the benchmark Web30k, a Gmail search, and a Google Drive Quick Access dataset. Experimental results show that our proposed methods are both more effective and efficient than baselines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[41] Title: Towards CRISP-ML(Q): A Machine Learning Process Model with Quality Assurance Methodology Abstract: Machine learning is an established and frequently used technique in industry and academia but a standard process model to improve success and efficiency of machine learning applications is still missing. Project organizations and machine learning practitioners have a need for guidance throughout the life cycle of a machine learning application to meet business expectations. We therefore propose a process model for the development of machine learning applications, that covers six phases from defining the scope to maintaining the deployed machine learning application. The first phase combines business and data understanding as data availability oftentimes affects the feasibility of the project. The sixth phase covers state-of-the-art approaches for monitoring and maintenance of a machine learning applications, as the risk of model degradation in a changing environment is eminent. With each task of the process, we propose quality assurance methodology that is suitable to adress challenges in machine learning development that we identify in form of risks. The methodology is drawn from practical experience and scientific literature and has proven to be general and stable. The process model expands on CRISP-DM, a data mining process model that enjoys strong industry support but lacks to address machine learning specific tasks. Our work proposes an industry and application neutral process model tailored for machine learning applications with focus on technical tasks for quality assurance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[42] Title: Dating Documents using Graph Convolution Networks Abstract: Document date is essential for many important tasks, such as document retrieval, summarization, event detection, etc. While existing approaches for these tasks assume accurate knowledge of the document date, this is not always available, especially for arbitrary documents from the Web. Document Dating is a challenging problem which requires inference over the temporal structure of the document. Prior document dating systems have largely relied on handcrafted features while ignoring such document internal structures. In this paper, we propose NeuralDater, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based document dating approach which jointly exploits syntactic and temporal graph structures of document in a principled way. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning for the problem of document dating. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we find that NeuralDater significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline by 19% absolute (45% relative) accuracy points.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[43] Title: DeepScanner: a Robotic System for Automated 2D Object Dataset Collection with Annotations Abstract: In the proposed study, we describe the possibility of automated dataset collection using an articulated robot. The proposed technology reduces the number of pixel errors on a polygonal dataset and the time spent on manual labeling of 2D objects. The paper describes a novel automatic dataset collection and annotation system, and compares the results of automated and manual dataset labeling. Our approach increases the speed of data labeling 240-fold, and improves the accuracy compared to manual labeling 13-fold. We also present a comparison of metrics for training a neural network on a manually annotated and an automatically collected dataset.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[44] Title: Continuous Lyapunov Controller and Chaotic Non-linear System Optimization using Deep Machine Learning Abstract: The introduction of unexpected system disturbances and new system dynamics does not allow guaranteed continuous system stability. In this research we present a novel approach for detecting early failure indicators of non-linear highly chaotic system and accordingly predict the best parameter calibrations to offset such instability using deep machine learning regression model. The approach proposed continuously monitors the system and controller signals. The Re-calibration of the system and controller parameters is triggered according to a set of conditions designed to maintain system stability without compromise to the system speed, intended outcome or required processing power. The deep neural model predicts the parameter values that would best counteract the expected system in-stability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is applied to the non-linear complex combination of Duffing Van der pol oscillators. The approach is also tested under different scenarios the system and controller parameters are initially chosen incorrectly or the system parameters are changed while running or new system dynamics are introduced while running to measure effectiveness and reaction time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[45] Title: Learning to See by Looking at Noise Abstract: Current vision systems are trained on huge datasets, and these datasets come with costs: curation is expensive, they inherit human biases, and there are concerns over privacy and usage rights. To counter these costs, interest has surged in learning from cheaper data sources, such as unlabeled images. In this paper we go a step further and ask if we can do away with real image datasets entirely, instead learning from noise processes. We investigate a suite of image generation models that produce images from simple random processes. These are then used as training data for a visual representation learner with a contrastive loss. We study two types of noise processes, statistical image models and deep generative models under different random initializations. Our findings show that it is important for the noise to capture certain structural properties of real data but that good performance can be achieved even with processes that are far from realistic. We also find that diversity is a key property to learn good representations. Datasets, models, and code are available at https://mbaradad.github.io/learning_with_noise.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[46] Title: Using anomaly detection to support classification of fast running (packaging) processes Abstract: In this paper we propose a new method to assist in labeling data arriving from fast running processes using anomaly detection. A result is the possibility to manually classify data arriving at a high rates to train machine learning models. To circumvent the problem of not having a real ground truth we propose specific metrics for model selection and validation of the results. The use case is taken from the food packaging industry, where processes are affected by regular but short breakdowns causing interruptions in the production process. Fast production rates make it hard for machine operators to identify the source and thus the cause of the breakdown. Self learning assistance systems can help them finding the root cause of the problem and assist the machine operator in applying lasting solutions. These learning systems need to be trained to identify reoccurring problems using data analytics. Training is not easy as the process is too fast to be manually monitored to add specific classifications on the single data points.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[47] Title: Unrepresentative video data: A review and evaluation Abstract: It is well known that the quality and quantity of training data are significant factors which affect the development and performance of machine intelligence algorithms. Without representative data, neither scientists nor algorithms would be able to accurately capture the visual details of objects, actions or scenes. An evaluation methodology which filters data quality does not yet exist, and currently, the validation of the data depends solely on human factor. This study reviews several public datasets and discusses their limitations and issues regarding quality, feasibility, adaptation and availability of training data. A simple approach to evaluate (i.e. automatically \"clean\" samples) training data is proposed with the use of real events recorded on the YouTube platform. This study focuses on action recognition data and particularly on human fall detection datasets. However, the limitations described in this paper apply in virtually all datasets.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[48] Title: Beyond Accuracy: ROI-driven Data Analytics of Empirical Data Abstract: This vision paper demonstrates that it is crucial to consider Return-on-Investment (ROI) when performing Data Analytics. Decisions on \"How much analytics is needed\"? are hard to answer. ROI could guide for decision support on the What?, How?, and How Much? analytics for a given problem. Method: The proposed conceptual framework is validated through two empirical studies that focus on requirements dependencies extraction in the Mozilla Firefox project. The two case studies are (i) Evaluation of fine-tuned BERT against Naive Bayes and Random Forest machine learners for binary dependency classification and (ii) Active Learning against passive Learning (random sampling) for REQUIRES dependency extraction. For both the cases, their analysis investment (cost) is estimated, and the achievable benefit from DA is predicted, to determine a break-even point of the investigation. Results: For the first study, fine-tuned BERT performed superior to the Random Forest, provided that more than 40% of training data is available. For the second, Active Learning achieved higher F1 accuracy within fewer iterations and higher ROI compared to Baseline (Random sampling based RF classifier). In both the studies, estimate on, How much analysis likely would pay off for the invested efforts?, was indicated by the break-even point. Conclusions: Decisions for the depth and breadth of DA of empirical data should not be made solely based on the accuracy measures. Since ROI-driven Data Analytics provides a simple yet effective direction to discover when to stop further investigation while considering the cost and value of the various types of analysis, it helps to avoid over-analyzing empirical data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[49] Title: Directly and Efficiently Optimizing Prediction Error and AUC of Linear Classifiers Abstract: The predictive quality of machine learning models is typically measured in terms of their (approximate) expected prediction error or the so-called Area Under the Curve (AUC) for a particular data distribution. However, when the models are constructed by the means of empirical risk minimization, surrogate functions such as the logistic loss are optimized instead. This is done because the empirical approximations of the expected error and AUC functions are nonconvex and nonsmooth, and more importantly have zero derivative almost everywhere. In this work, we show that in the case of linear predictors, and under the assumption that the data has normal distribution, the expected error and the expected AUC are not only smooth, but have closed form expressions, which depend on the first and second moments of the normal distribution. Hence, we derive derivatives of these two functions and use these derivatives in an optimization algorithm to directly optimize the expected error and the AUC. In the case of real data sets, the derivatives can be approximated using empirical moments. We show that even when data is not normally distributed, computed derivatives are sufficiently useful to render an efficient optimization method and high quality solutions. Thus, we propose a gradient-based optimization method for direct optimization of the prediction error and AUC. Moreover, the per-iteration complexity of the proposed algorithm has no dependence on the size of the data set, unlike those for optimizing logistic regression and all other well known empirical risk minimization problems.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[50] Title: Estimating Rationally Inattentive Utility Functions with Deep Clustering for Framing - Applications in YouTube Engagement Dynamics Abstract: We consider a framework involving behavioral economics and machine learning. Rationally inattentive Bayesian agents make decisions based on their posterior distribution, utility function and information acquisition cost Renyi divergence which generalizes Shannon mutual information). By observing these decisions, how can an observer estimate the utility function and information acquisition cost? Using deep learning, we estimate framing information (essential extrinsic features) that determines the agent\\'s attention strategy. Then we present a preference based inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to test for rational inattention: is the agent an utility maximizer, attention maximizer, and does an information cost function exist that rationalizes the data? The test imposes a Renyi mutual information constraint which impacts how the agent can select attention strategies to maximize their expected utility. The test provides constructive estimates of the utility function and information acquisition cost of the agent. We illustrate these methods on a massive YouTube dataset for characterizing the commenting behavior of users.\\n\\nYour ranking (most to least relevant):<end_of_turn>\\n<start_of_turn>model\\n[13] > [14] > [18] > [40] > [47] > [1] > [2] > [3] > [4] > [5] > [6] > [7] > [8] > [9] > [10] > [11] > [12] > [15] > [16] > [17] > [19] > [20] > [21] > [22] > [23] > [24] > [25] > [26] > [27] > [28] > [29] > [30] > [31] > [32] > [33] > [34] > [35] > [36] > [37] > [38] > [39] > [41] > [42] > [43] > [44] > [45] > [46] > [48] > [49] > [50]<end_of_turn>\\n',\n",

In this paper, we study importance labeling problem, in which we are given many unlabeled data and select a limited number of data to be labeled from the unlabeled data, and then a learning algorithm is executed on the selected one. We propose a new importance labeling scheme that can effectively select an informative subset of unlabeled data in least squares regression in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). We analyze the generalization error of gradient descent combined with our labeling scheme and show that the proposed algorithm achieves the optimal rate of convergence in much wider settings and especially gives much better generalization ability in a small label noise setting than the usual uniform sampling scheme. Numerical experiments verify our theoretical findings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[3] Title: Evaluating Predictive Uncertainty and Robustness to Distributional Shift Using Real World Data Abstract: Most machine learning models operate under the assumption that the training, testing and deployment data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This assumption doesn\\'t generally hold true in a natural setting. Usually, the deployment data is subject to various types of distributional shifts. The magnitude of a model\\'s performance is proportional to this shift in the distribution of the dataset. Thus it becomes necessary to evaluate a model\\'s uncertainty and robustness to distributional shifts to get a realistic estimate of its expected performance on real-world data. Present methods to evaluate uncertainty and model\\'s robustness are lacking and often fail to paint the full picture. Moreover, most analysis so far has primarily focused on classification tasks. In this paper, we propose more insightful metrics for general regression tasks using the Shifts Weather Prediction Dataset. We also present an evaluation of the baseline methods using these metrics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[4] Title: Image Classification with Deep Learning in the Presence of Noisy Labels: A Survey Abstract: Image classification systems recently made a giant leap with the advancement of deep neural networks. However, these systems require an excessive amount of labeled data to be adequately trained. Gathering a correctly annotated dataset is not always feasible due to several factors, such as the expensiveness of the labeling process or difficulty of correctly classifying data, even for the experts. Because of these practical challenges, label noise is a common problem in real-world datasets, and numerous methods to train deep neural networks with label noise are proposed in the literature. Although deep neural networks are known to be relatively robust to label noise, their tendency to overfit data makes them vulnerable to memorizing even random noise. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the existence of label noise and develop counter algorithms to fade away its adverse effects to train deep neural networks efficiently. Even though an extensive survey of machine learning techniques under label noise exists, the literature lacks a comprehensive survey of methodologies centered explicitly around deep learning in the presence of noisy labels. This paper aims to present these algorithms while categorizing them into one of the two subgroups: noise model based and noise model free methods. Algorithms in the first group aim to estimate the noise structure and use this information to avoid the adverse effects of noisy labels. Differently, methods in the second group try to come up with inherently noise robust algorithms by using approaches like robust losses, regularizers or other learning paradigms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[5] Title: Combining Crowd and Machines for Multi-predicate Item Screening Abstract: This paper discusses how crowd and machine classifiers can be efficiently combined to screen items that satisfy a set of predicates. We show that this is a recurring problem in many domains, present machine-human (hybrid) algorithms that screen items efficiently and estimate the gain over human-only or machine-only screening in terms of performance and cost. We further show how, given a new classification problem and a set of classifiers of unknown accuracy for the problem at hand, we can identify how to manage the cost-accuracy trade off by progressively determining if we should spend budget to obtain test data (to assess the accuracy of the given classifiers), or to train an ensemble of classifiers, or whether we should leverage the existing machine classifiers with the crowd, and in this case how to efficiently combine them based on their estimated characteristics to obtain the classification. We demonstrate that the techniques we propose obtain significant cost/accuracy improvements with respect to the leading classification algorithms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[6] Title: Sequential Neural Processes Abstract: Neural Processes combine the strengths of neural networks and Gaussian processes to achieve both flexible learning and fast prediction in stochastic processes. However, a large class of problems comprises underlying temporal dependency structures in a sequence of stochastic processes that Neural Processes (NP) do not explicitly consider. In this paper, we propose Sequential Neural Processes (SNP) which incorporates a temporal state-transition model of stochastic processes and thus extends its modeling capabilities to dynamic stochastic processes. In applying SNP to dynamic 3D scene modeling, we introduce the Temporal Generative Query Networks. To our knowledge, this is the first 4D model that can deal with the temporal dynamics of 3D scenes. In experiments, we evaluate the proposed methods in dynamic (non-stationary) regression and 4D scene inference and rendering.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[7] Title: Bounded Expectation of Label Assignment: Dataset Annotation by Supervised Splitting with Bias-Reduction Techniques Abstract: Annotating large unlabeled datasets can be a major bottleneck for machine learning applications. We introduce a scheme for inferring labels of unlabeled data at a fraction of the cost of labeling the entire dataset. Our scheme, bounded expectation of label assignment (BELA), greedily queries an oracle (or human labeler) and partitions a dataset to find data subsets that have mostly the same label. BELA can then infer labels by majority vote of the known labels in each subset. BELA determines whether to split or label from a subset by maximizing a lower bound on the expected number of correctly labeled examples. Our approach differs from existing hierarchical labeling schemes by using supervised models to partition the data, therefore avoiding reliance on unsupervised clustering methods that may not accurately group data by label. We design BELA with strategies to avoid bias that could be introduced through this adaptive partitioning. We evaluate BELA on three datasets and find that it outperforms existing strategies for adaptive labeling.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[8] Title: An Empirical Study on the Intrinsic Privacy of SGD Abstract: Introducing noise in the training of machine learning systems is a powerful way to protect individual privacy via differential privacy guarantees, but comes at a cost to utility. This work looks at whether the inherent randomness of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) could contribute to privacy, effectively reducing the amount of \\\\emph{additional} noise required to achieve a given privacy guarantee. We conduct a large-scale empirical study to examine this question. Training a grid of over 120,000 models across four datasets (tabular and images) on convex and non-convex objectives, we demonstrate that the random seed has a larger impact on model weights than any individual training example. We test the distribution over weights induced by the seed, finding that the simple convex case can be modelled with a multivariate Gaussian posterior, while neural networks exhibit multi-modal and non-Gaussian weight distributions. By casting convex SGD as a Gaussian mechanism, we then estimate an `intrinsic\\' data-dependent $\\\\epsilon_i(\\\\mathcal{D})$, finding values as low as 6.3, dropping to 1.9 using empirical estimates. We use a membership inference attack to estimate $\\\\epsilon$ for non-convex SGD and demonstrate that hiding the random seed from the adversary results in a statistically significant reduction in attack performance, corresponding to a reduction in the effective $\\\\epsilon$. These results provide empirical evidence that SGD exhibits appreciable variability relative to its dataset sensitivity, and this `intrinsic noise\\' has the potential to be leveraged to improve the utility of privacy-preserving machine learning.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[9] Title: Coupling the reduced-order model and the generative model for an importance sampling estimator Abstract: In this work, we develop an importance sampling estimator by coupling the reduced-order model and the generative model in a problem setting of uncertainty quantification. The target is to estimate the probability that the quantity of interest (QoI) in a complex system is beyond a given threshold. To avoid the prohibitive cost of sampling a large scale system, the reduced-order model is usually considered for a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. However, the Monte Carlo estimator given by the reduced-order model is biased due to the error from dimension reduction. To correct the bias, we still need to sample the fine model. An effective technique to reduce the variance reduction is importance sampling, where we employ the generative model to estimate the distribution of the data from the reduced-order model and use it for the change of measure in the importance sampling estimator. To compensate the approximation errors of the reduced-order model, more data that induce a slightly smaller QoI than the threshold need to be included into the training set. Although the amount of these data can be controlled by a posterior error estimate, redundant data, which may outnumber the effective data, will be kept due to the epistemic uncertainty. To deal with this issue, we introduce a weighted empirical distribution to process the data from the reduced-order model. The generative model is then trained by minimizing the cross entropy between it and the weighted empirical distribution. We also introduce a penalty term into the objective function to deal with the overfitting for more robustness. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[10] Title: Guided Labeling using Convolutional Neural Networks Abstract: Over the last couple of years, deep learning and especially convolutional neural networks have become one of the work horses of computer vision. One limiting factor for the applicability of supervised deep learning to more areas is the need for large, manually labeled datasets. In this paper we propose an easy to implement method we call guided labeling, which automatically determines which samples from an unlabeled dataset should be labeled. We show that using this procedure, the amount of samples that need to be labeled is reduced considerably in comparison to labeling images arbitrarily.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[11] Title: An interpretable semi-supervised classifier using two different strategies for amended self-labeling Abstract: In the context of some machine learning applications, obtaining data instances is a relatively easy process but labeling them could become quite expensive or tedious. Such scenarios lead to datasets with few labeled instances and a larger number of unlabeled ones. Semi-supervised classification techniques combine labeled and unlabeled data during the learning phase in order to increase the classifier\\'s generalization capability. Regrettably, most successful semi-supervised classifiers do not allow explaining their outcome, thus behaving like black boxes. However, there is an increasing number of problem domains in which experts demand a clear understanding of the decision process. In this paper, we report on an extended experimental study presenting an interpretable self-labeling grey-box classifier that uses a black box to estimate the missing class labels and a white box to explain the final predictions. Two different approaches for amending the self-labeling process are explored: a first one based on the confidence of the black box and the latter one based on measures from Rough Set Theory. The results of the extended experimental study support the interpretability by means of transparency and simplicity of our classifier, while attaining superior prediction rates when compared with state-of-the-art self-labeling classifiers reported in the literature.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[12] Title: Content-based similar document image retrieval using fusion of CNN features Abstract: Rapid increase of digitized document give birth to high demand of document image retrieval. While conventional document image retrieval approaches depend on complex OCR-based text recognition and text similarity detection, this paper proposes a new content-based approach, in which more attention is paid to features extraction and fusion. In the proposed approach, multiple features of document images are extracted by different CNN models. After that, the extracted CNN features are reduced and fused into weighted average feature. Finally, the document images are ranked based on feature similarity to a provided query image. Experimental procedure is performed on a group of document images that transformed from academic papers, which contain both English and Chinese document, the results show that the proposed approach has good ability to retrieve document images with similar text content, and the fusion of CNN features can effectively improve the retrieval accuracy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[13] Title: Cost-Sensitive Feature-Value Acquisition Using Feature Relevance Abstract: In many real-world machine learning problems, feature values are not readily available. To make predictions, some of the missing features have to be acquired, which can incur a cost in money, computational time, or human time, depending on the problem domain. This leads us to the problem of choosing which features to use at the prediction time. The chosen features should increase the prediction accuracy for a low cost, but determining which features will do that is challenging. The choice should take into account the previously acquired feature values as well as the feature costs. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this problem. The proposed approach chooses the most useful features adaptively based on how relevant they are for the prediction task as well as what the corresponding feature costs are. Our approach uses a generic neural network architecture, which is suitable for a wide range of problems. We evaluate our approach on three cost-sensitive datasets, including Yahoo! Learning to Rank Competition dataset as well as two health datasets. We show that our approach achieves high accuracy with a lower cost than the current state-of-the-art approaches.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[14] Title: Forward Thinking: Building Deep Random Forests Abstract: The success of deep neural networks has inspired many to wonder whether other learners could benefit from deep, layered architectures. We present a general framework called forward thinking for deep learning that generalizes the architectural flexibility and sophistication of deep neural networks while also allowing for (i) different types of learning functions in the network, other than neurons, and (ii) the ability to adaptively deepen the network as needed to improve results. This is done by training one layer at a time, and once a layer is trained, the input data are mapped forward through the layer to create a new learning problem. The process is then repeated, transforming the data through multiple layers, one at a time, rendering a new dataset, which is expected to be better behaved, and on which a final output layer can achieve good performance. In the case where the neurons of deep neural nets are replaced with decision trees, we call the result a Forward Thinking Deep Random Forest (FTDRF). We demonstrate a proof of concept by applying FTDRF on the MNIST dataset. We also provide a general mathematical formulation that allows for other types of deep learning problems to be considered.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[15] Title: Bridging the Gap: Machine Learning to Resolve Improperly Modeled Dynamics Abstract: We present a data-driven modeling strategy to overcome improperly modeled dynamics for systems exhibiting complex spatio-temporal behaviors. We propose a Deep Learning framework to resolve the differences between the true dynamics of the system and the dynamics given by a model of the system that is either inaccurately or inadequately described. Our machine learning strategy leverages data generated from the improper system model and observational data from the actual system to create a neural network to model the dynamics of the actual system. We evaluate the proposed framework using numerical solutions obtained from three increasingly complex dynamical systems. Our results show that our system is capable of learning a data-driven model that provides accurate estimates of the system states both in previously unobserved regions as well as for future states. Our results show the power of state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks in estimating an accurate prior of the system\\'s true dynamics that can be used for prediction up to a finite horizon.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[16] Title: Modelling and Quantifying Membership Information Leakage in Machine Learning Abstract: Machine learning models have been shown to be vulnerable to membership inference attacks, i.e., inferring whether individuals\\' data have been used for training models. The lack of understanding about factors contributing success of these attacks motivates the need for modelling membership information leakage using information theory and for investigating properties of machine learning models and training algorithms that can reduce membership information leakage. We use conditional mutual information leakage to measure the amount of information leakage from the trained machine learning model about the presence of an individual in the training dataset. We devise an upper bound for this measure of information leakage using Kullback--Leibler divergence that is more amenable to numerical computation. We prove a direct relationship between the Kullback--Leibler membership information leakage and the probability of success for a hypothesis-testing adversary examining whether a particular data record belongs to the training dataset of a machine learning model. We show that the mutual information leakage is a decreasing function of the training dataset size and the regularization weight. We also prove that, if the sensitivity of the machine learning model (defined in terms of the derivatives of the fitness with respect to model parameters) is high, more membership information is potentially leaked. This illustrates that complex models, such as deep neural networks, are more susceptible to membership inference attacks in comparison to simpler models with fewer degrees of freedom. We show that the amount of the membership information leakage is reduced by $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log^{1/2}(\\\\delta^{-1})\\\\epsilon^{-1})$ when using Gaussian $(\\\\epsilon,\\\\delta)$-differentially-private additive noises.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[17] Title: Anomaly Detection Under Controlled Sensing Using Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning Abstract: We consider the problem of detecting anomalies among a given set of processes using their noisy binary sensor measurements. The noiseless sensor measurement corresponding to a normal process is 0, and the measurement is 1 if the process is anomalous. The decision-making algorithm is assumed to have no knowledge of the number of anomalous processes. The algorithm is allowed to choose a subset of the sensors at each time instant until the confidence level on the decision exceeds the desired value. Our objective is to design a sequential sensor selection policy that dynamically determines which processes to observe at each time and when to terminate the detection algorithm. The selection policy is designed such that the anomalous processes are detected with the desired confidence level while incurring minimum cost which comprises the delay in detection and the cost of sensing. We cast this problem as a sequential hypothesis testing problem within the framework of Markov decision processes, and solve it using the actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm. This deep neural network-based algorithm offers a low complexity solution with good detection accuracy. We also study the effect of statistical dependence between the processes on the algorithm performance. Through numerical experiments, we show that our algorithm is able to adapt to any unknown statistical dependence pattern of the processes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[18] Title: Data Collection and Quality Challenges in Deep Learning: A Data-Centric AI Perspective Abstract: Data-centric AI is at the center of a fundamental shift in software engineering where machine learning becomes the new software, powered by big data and computing infrastructure. Here software engineering needs to be re-thought where data becomes a first-class citizen on par with code. One striking observation is that a significant portion of the machine learning process is spent on data preparation. Without good data, even the best machine learning algorithms cannot perform well. As a result, data-centric AI practices are now becoming mainstream. Unfortunately, many datasets in the real world are small, dirty, biased, and even poisoned. In this survey, we study the research landscape for data collection and data quality primarily for deep learning applications. Data collection is important because there is lesser need for feature engineering for recent deep learning approaches, but instead more need for large amounts of data. For data quality, we study data validation, cleaning, and integration techniques. Even if the data cannot be fully cleaned, we can still cope with imperfect data during model training using robust model training techniques. In addition, while bias and fairness have been less studied in traditional data management research, these issues become essential topics in modern machine learning applications. We thus study fairness measures and unfairness mitigation techniques that can be applied before, during, or after model training. We believe that the data management community is well poised to solve these problems.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[19] Title: Time-Sensitive Bayesian Information Aggregation for Crowdsourcing Systems Abstract: Crowdsourcing systems commonly face the problem of aggregating multiple judgments provided by potentially unreliable workers. In addition, several aspects of the design of efficient crowdsourcing processes, such as defining worker\\'s bonuses, fair prices and time limits of the tasks, involve knowledge of the likely duration of the task at hand. Bringing this together, in this work we introduce a new time--sensitive Bayesian aggregation method that simultaneously estimates a task\\'s duration and obtains reliable aggregations of crowdsourced judgments. Our method, called BCCTime, builds on the key insight that the time taken by a worker to perform a task is an important indicator of the likely quality of the produced judgment. To capture this, BCCTime uses latent variables to represent the uncertainty about the workers\\' completion time, the tasks\\' duration and the workers\\' accuracy. To relate the quality of a judgment to the time a worker spends on a task, our model assumes that each task is completed within a latent time window within which all workers with a propensity to genuinely attempt the labelling task (i.e., no spammers) are expected to submit their judgments. In contrast, workers with a lower propensity to valid labeling, such as spammers, bots or lazy labelers, are assumed to perform tasks considerably faster or slower than the time required by normal workers. Specifically, we use efficient message-passing Bayesian inference to learn approximate posterior probabilities of (i) the confusion matrix of each worker, (ii) the propensity to valid labeling of each worker, (iii) the unbiased duration of each task and (iv) the true label of each task. Using two real-world public datasets for entity linking tasks, we show that BCCTime produces up to 11% more accurate classifications and up to 100% more informative estimates of a task\\'s duration\\n\\n---\\n\\n[20] Title: Enabling Smart Data: Noise filtering in Big Data classification Abstract: In any knowledge discovery process the value of extracted knowledge is directly related to the quality of the data used. Big Data problems, generated by massive growth in the scale of data observed in recent years, also follow the same dictate. A common problem affecting data quality is the presence of noise, particularly in classification problems, where label noise refers to the incorrect labeling of training instances, and is known to be a very disruptive feature of data. However, in this Big Data era, the massive growth in the scale of the data poses a challenge to traditional proposals created to tackle noise, as they have difficulties coping with such a large amount of data. New algorithms need to be proposed to treat the noise in Big Data problems, providing high quality and clean data, also known as Smart Data. In this paper, two Big Data preprocessing approaches to remove noisy examples are proposed: an homogeneous ensemble and an heterogeneous ensemble filter, with special emphasis in their scalability and performance traits. The obtained results show that these proposals enable the practitioner to efficiently obtain a Smart Dataset from any Big Data classification problem.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[21] Title: DISCO: Influence Maximization Meets Network Embedding and Deep Learning Abstract: Since its introduction in 2003, the influence maximization (IM) problem has drawn significant research attention in the literature. The aim of IM is to select a set of k users who can influence the most individuals in the social network. The problem is proven to be NP-hard. A large number of approximate algorithms have been proposed to address this problem. The state-of-the-art algorithms estimate the expected influence of nodes based on sampled diffusion paths. As the number of required samples have been recently proven to be lower bounded by a particular threshold that presets tradeoff between the accuracy and efficiency, the result quality of these traditional solutions is hard to be further improved without sacrificing efficiency. In this paper, we present an orthogonal and novel paradigm to address the IM problem by leveraging deep learning models to estimate the expected influence. Specifically, we present a novel framework called DISCO that incorporates network embedding and deep reinforcement learning techniques to address this problem. Experimental study on real-world networks demonstrates that DISCO achieves the best performance w.r.t efficiency and influence spread quality compared to state-of-the-art classical solutions. Besides, we also show that the learning model exhibits good generality.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[22] Title: Privacy-preserving Machine Learning through Data Obfuscation Abstract: As machine learning becomes a practice and commodity, numerous cloud-based services and frameworks are provided to help customers develop and deploy machine learning applications. While it is prevalent to outsource model training and serving tasks in the cloud, it is important to protect the privacy of sensitive samples in the training dataset and prevent information leakage to untrusted third parties. Past work have shown that a malicious machine learning service provider or end user can easily extract critical information about the training samples, from the model parameters or even just model outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic methodology to preserve the privacy of training data in machine learning applications. Specifically we introduce an obfuscate function and apply it to the training data before feeding them to the model training task. This function adds random noise to existing samples, or augments the dataset with new samples. By doing so sensitive information about the properties of individual samples, or statistical properties of a group of samples, is hidden. Meanwhile the model trained from the obfuscated dataset can still achieve high accuracy. With this approach, the customers can safely disclose the data or models to third-party providers or end users without the need to worry about data privacy. Our experiments show that this approach can effective defeat four existing types of machine learning privacy attacks at negligible accuracy cost.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[23] Title: A deep active learning system for species identification and counting in camera trap images Abstract: Biodiversity conservation depends on accurate, up-to-date information about wildlife population distributions. Motion-activated cameras, also known as camera traps, are a critical tool for population surveys, as they are cheap and non-intrusive. However, extracting useful information from camera trap images is a cumbersome process: a typical camera trap survey may produce millions of images that require slow, expensive manual review. Consequently, critical information is often lost due to resource limitations, and critical conservation questions may be answered too slowly to support decision-making. Computer vision is poised to dramatically increase efficiency in image-based biodiversity surveys, and recent studies have harnessed deep learning techniques for automatic information extraction from camera trap images. However, the accuracy of results depends on the amount, quality, and diversity of the data available to train models, and the literature has focused on projects with millions of relevant, labeled training images. Many camera trap projects do not have a large set of labeled images and hence cannot benefit from existing machine learning techniques. Furthermore, even projects that do have labeled data from similar ecosystems have struggled to adopt deep learning methods because image classification models overfit to specific image backgrounds (i.e., camera locations). In this paper, we focus not on automating the labeling of camera trap images, but on accelerating this process. We combine the power of machine intelligence and human intelligence to build a scalable, fast, and accurate active learning system to minimize the manual work required to identify and count animals in camera trap images. Our proposed scheme can match the state of the art accuracy on a 3.2 million image dataset with as few as 14,100 manual labels, which means decreasing manual labeling effort by over 99.5%.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[24] Title: Robust Triple-Matrix-Recovery-Based Auto-Weighted Label Propagation for Classification Abstract: The graph-based semi-supervised label propagation algorithm has delivered impressive classification results. However, the estimated soft labels typically contain mixed signs and noise, which cause inaccurate predictions due to the lack of suitable constraints. Moreover, available methods typically calculate the weights and estimate the labels in the original input space, which typically contains noise and corruption. Thus, the en-coded similarities and manifold smoothness may be inaccurate for label estimation. In this paper, we present effective schemes for resolving these issues and propose a novel and robust semi-supervised classification algorithm, namely, the tri-ple-matrix-recovery-based robust auto-weighted label propa-gation framework (ALP-TMR). Our ALP-TMR introduces a triple matrix recovery mechanism to remove noise or mixed signs from the estimated soft labels and improve the robustness to noise and outliers in the steps of assigning weights and pre-dicting the labels simultaneously. Our method can jointly re-cover the underlying clean data, clean labels and clean weighting spaces by decomposing the original data, predicted soft labels or weights into a clean part plus an error part by fitting noise. In addition, ALP-TMR integrates the au-to-weighting process by minimizing reconstruction errors over the recovered clean data and clean soft labels, which can en-code the weights more accurately to improve both data rep-resentation and classification. By classifying samples in the recovered clean label and weight spaces, one can potentially improve the label prediction results. The results of extensive experiments demonstrated the satisfactory performance of our ALP-TMR.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[25] Title: A Unified Generative Adversarial Network Training via Self-Labeling and Self-Attention Abstract: We propose a novel GAN training scheme that can handle any level of labeling in a unified manner. Our scheme introduces a form of artificial labeling that can incorporate manually defined labels, when available, and induce an alignment between them. To define the artificial labels, we exploit the assumption that neural network generators can be trained more easily to map nearby latent vectors to data with semantic similarities, than across separate categories. We use generated data samples and their corresponding artificial conditioning labels to train a classifier. The classifier is then used to self-label real data. To boost the accuracy of the self-labeling, we also use the exponential moving average of the classifier. However, because the classifier might still make mistakes, especially at the beginning of the training, we also refine the labels through self-attention, by using the labeling of real data samples only when the classifier outputs a high classification probability score. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, STL-10 and SVHN, and show that both self-labeling and self-attention consistently improve the quality of generated data. More surprisingly, we find that the proposed scheme can even outperform class-conditional GANs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[26] Title: LeagueAI: Improving object detector performance and flexibility through automatically generated training data and domain randomization Abstract: In this technical report I present my method for automatic synthetic dataset generation for object detection and demonstrate it on the video game League of Legends. This report furthermore serves as a handbook on how to automatically generate datasets and as an introduction on the dataset generation part of the LeagueAI framework. The LeagueAI framework is a software framework that provides detailed information about the game League of Legends based on the same input a human player would have, namely vision. The framework allows researchers and enthusiasts to develop their own intelligent agents or to extract detailed information about the state of the game. A big problem of machine vision applications usually is the laborious work of gathering large amounts of hand labeled data. Thus, a crucial part of the vision pipeline of the LeagueAI framework, the dataset generation, is presented in this report. The method involves extracting image raw data from the game\\'s 3D models and combining them with the game background to create game-like synthetic images and to generate the corresponding labels automatically. In an experiment I compared a model trained on synthetic data to a model trained on hand labeled data and a model trained on a combined dataset. The model trained on the synthetic data showed higher detection precision on more classes and more reliable tracking performance of the player character. The model trained on the combined dataset did not perform better because of the different formats of the older hand labeled dataset and the synthetic data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[27] Title: Data Programming using Continuous and Quality-Guided Labeling Functions Abstract: Scarcity of labeled data is a bottleneck for supervised learning models. A paradigm that has evolved for dealing with this problem is data programming. An existing data programming paradigm allows human supervision to be provided as a set of discrete labeling functions (LF) that output possibly noisy labels to input instances and a generative modelfor consolidating the weak labels. We enhance and generalize this paradigm by supporting functions that output a continuous score (instead of a hard label) that noisily correlates with labels. We show across five applications that continuous LFs are more natural to program and lead to improved recall. We also show that accuracy of existing generative models is unstable with respect to initialization, training epochs, and learning rates. We give control to the data programmer to guide the training process by providing intuitive quality guides with each LF. We propose an elegant method of incorporating these guides into the generative model. Our overall method, called CAGE, makes the data programming paradigm more reliable than other tricks based on initialization, sign-penalties, or soft-accuracy constraints.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[28] Title: Jasmine: A New Active Learning Approach to Combat Cybercrime Abstract: Over the past decade, the advent of cybercrime has accelarated the research on cybersecurity. However, the deployment of intrusion detection methods falls short. One of the reasons for this is the lack of realistic evaluation datasets, which makes it a challenge to develop techniques and compare them. This is caused by the large amounts of effort it takes for a cyber analyst to classify network connections. This has raised the need for methods (i) that can learn from small sets of labeled data, (ii) that can make predictions on large sets of unlabeled data, and (iii) that request the label of only specially selected unlabeled data instances. Hence, Active Learning (AL) methods are of interest. These approaches choose specific unlabeled instances by a query function that are expected to improve overall classification performance. The resulting query observations are labeled by a human expert and added to the labeled set. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid AL method called Jasmine. Firstly, it determines how suitable each observation is for querying, i.e., how likely it is to enhance classification. These properties are the uncertainty score and anomaly score. Secondly, Jasmine introduces dynamic updating. This allows the model to adjust the balance between querying uncertain, anomalous and randomly selected observations. To this end, Jasmine is able to learn the best query strategy during the labeling process. This is in contrast to the other AL methods in cybersecurity that all have static, predetermined query functions. We show that dynamic updating, and therefore Jasmine, is able to consistently obtain good and more robust results than querying only uncertainties, only anomalies or a fixed combination of the two.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[29] Title: What is the Value of Data? On Mathematical Methods for Data Quality Estimation Abstract: Data is one of the most important assets of the information age, and its societal impact is undisputed. Yet, rigorous methods of assessing the quality of data are lacking. In this paper, we propose a formal definition for the quality of a given dataset. We assess a dataset\\'s quality by a quantity we call the expected diameter, which measures the expected disagreement between two randomly chosen hypotheses that explain it, and has recently found applications in active learning. We focus on Boolean hyperplanes, and utilize a collection of Fourier analytic, algebraic, and probabilistic methods to come up with theoretical guarantees and practical solutions for the computation of the expected diameter. We also study the behaviour of the expected diameter on algebraically structured datasets, conduct experiments that validate this notion of quality, and demonstrate the feasibility of our techniques.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[30] Title: Health Indicator Forecasting for Improving Remaining Useful Life Estimation Abstract: Prognostics is concerned with predicting the future health of the equipment and any potential failures. With the advances in the Internet of Things (IoT), data-driven approaches for prognostics that leverage the power of machine learning models are gaining popularity. One of the most important categories of data-driven approaches relies on a predefined or learned health indicator to characterize the equipment condition up to the present time and make inference on how it is likely to evolve in the future. In these approaches, health indicator forecasting that constructs the health indicator curve over the lifespan using partially observed measurements (i.e., health indicator values within an initial period) plays a key role. Existing health indicator forecasting algorithms, such as the functional Empirical Bayesian approach, the regression-based formulation, a naive scenario matching based on the nearest neighbor, have certain limitations. In this paper, we propose a new `generative + scenario matching\\' algorithm for health indicator forecasting. The key idea behind the proposed approach is to first non-parametrically fit the underlying health indicator curve with a continuous Gaussian Process using a sample of run-to-failure health indicator curves. The proposed approach then generates a rich set of random curves from the learned distribution, attempting to obtain all possible variations of the target health condition evolution process over the system\\'s lifespan. The health indicator extrapolation for a piece of functioning equipment is inferred as the generated curve that has the highest matching level within the observed period. Our experimental results show the superiority of our algorithm over the other state-of-the-art methods.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[31] Title: Benchmarking Processor Performance by Multi-Threaded Machine Learning Algorithms Abstract: Machine learning algorithms have enabled computers to predict things by learning from previous data. The data storage and processing power are increasing rapidly, thus increasing machine learning and Artificial intelligence applications. Much of the work is done to improve the accuracy of the models built in the past, with little research done to determine the computational costs of machine learning acquisitions. In this paper, I will proceed with this later research work and will make a performance comparison of multi-threaded machine learning clustering algorithms. I will be working on Linear Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors to determine the performance characteristics of the algorithms as well as the computation costs to the obtained results. I will be benchmarking system hardware performance by running these multi-threaded algorithms to train and test the models on a dataset to note the differences in performance matrices of the algorithms. In the end, I will state the best performing algorithms concerning the performance efficiency of these algorithms on my system.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[32] Title: Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Process Mining: A General Overview and Application of a Novel Local Explanation Approach for Predictive Process Monitoring Abstract: The contemporary process-aware information systems possess the capabilities to record the activities generated during the process execution. To leverage these process specific fine-granular data, process mining has recently emerged as a promising research discipline. As an important branch of process mining, predictive business process management, pursues the objective to generate forward-looking, predictive insights to shape business processes. In this study, we propose a conceptual framework sought to establish and promote understanding of decision-making environment, underlying business processes and nature of the user characteristics for developing explainable business process prediction solutions. Consequently, with regard to the theoretical and practical implications of the framework, this study proposes a novel local post-hoc explanation approach for a deep learning classifier that is expected to facilitate the domain experts in justifying the model decisions. In contrary to alternative popular perturbation-based local explanation approaches, this study defines the local regions from the validation dataset by using the intermediate latent space representations learned by the deep neural networks. To validate the applicability of the proposed explanation method, the real-life process log data delivered by the Volvo IT Belgium\\'s incident management system are used.The adopted deep learning classifier achieves a good performance with the Area Under the ROC Curve of 0.94. The generated local explanations are also visualized and presented with relevant evaluation measures that are expected to increase the users\\' trust in the black-box-model.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[33] Title: Automated Machine Learning: State-of-The-Art and Open Challenges Abstract: With the continuous and vast increase in the amount of data in our digital world, it has been acknowledged that the number of knowledgeable data scientists can not scale to address these challenges. Thus, there was a crucial need for automating the process of building good machine learning models. In the last few years, several techniques and frameworks have been introduced to tackle the challenge of automating the process of Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyper-parameter tuning (CASH) in the machine learning domain. The main aim of these techniques is to reduce the role of the human in the loop and fill the gap for non-expert machine learning users by playing the role of the domain expert. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey for the state-of-the-art efforts in tackling the CASH problem. In addition, we highlight the research work of automating the other steps of the full complex machine learning pipeline (AutoML) from data understanding till model deployment. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive coverage for the various tools and frameworks that have been introduced in this domain. Finally, we discuss some of the research directions and open challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve the vision and goals of the AutoML process.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[34] Title: Label Noise Types and Their Effects on Deep Learning Abstract: The recent success of deep learning is mostly due to the availability of big datasets with clean annotations. However, gathering a cleanly annotated dataset is not always feasible due to practical challenges. As a result, label noise is a common problem in datasets, and numerous methods to train deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels are proposed in the literature. These methods commonly use benchmark datasets with synthetic label noise on the training set. However, there are multiple types of label noise, and each of them has its own characteristic impact on learning. Since each work generates a different kind of label noise, it is problematic to test and compare those algorithms in the literature fairly. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the effects of different kinds of label noise on learning. Moreover, we propose a generic framework to generate feature-dependent label noise, which we show to be the most challenging case for learning. Our proposed method aims to emphasize similarities among data instances by sparsely distributing them in the feature domain. By this approach, samples that are more likely to be mislabeled are detected from their softmax probabilities, and their labels are flipped to the corresponding class. The proposed method can be applied to any clean dataset to synthesize feature-dependent noisy labels. For the ease of other researchers to test their algorithms with noisy labels, we share corrupted labels for the most commonly used benchmark datasets. Our code and generated noisy synthetic labels are available online.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[35] Title: Online Model Selection: a Rested Bandit Formulation Abstract: Motivated by a natural problem in online model selection with bandit information, we introduce and analyze a best arm identification problem in the rested bandit setting, wherein arm expected losses decrease with the number of times the arm has been played. The shape of the expected loss functions is similar across arms, and is assumed to be available up to unknown parameters that have to be learned on the fly. We define a novel notion of regret for this problem, where we compare to the policy that always plays the arm having the smallest expected loss at the end of the game. We analyze an arm elimination algorithm whose regret vanishes as the time horizon increases. The actual rate of convergence depends in a detailed way on the postulated functional form of the expected losses. Unlike known model selection efforts in the recent bandit literature, our algorithm exploits the specific structure of the problem to learn the unknown parameters of the expected loss function so as to identify the best arm as quickly as possible. We complement our analysis with a lower bound, indicating strengths and limitations of the proposed solution.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[36] Title: Convolutional LSTM Neural Networks for Modeling Wildland Fire Dynamics Abstract: As the climate changes, the severity of wildland fires is expected to worsen. Models that accurately capture fire propagation dynamics greatly help efforts for understanding, responding to and mitigating the damages caused by these fires. Machine learning techniques provide a potential approach for developing such models. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) recurrent neural network to model the dynamics of wildland fire propagation. The machine learning model is trained on simulated wildfire data generated by a mathematical analogue model. Three simulated datasets are analyzed, each with increasing degrees of complexity. The simplest dataset includes a constant wind direction as a single confounding factor, whereas the most complex dataset includes dynamic wind, complex terrain, spatially varying moisture content and heterogenous vegetation density distributions. We examine how effective the ConvLSTM can learn the fire-spread dynamics over consecutive time steps. It is shown that ConvLSTMs can capture local fire transmission events, as well as the overall fire dynamics, such as the rate at which the fire spreads. Finally, we demonstrate that ConvLSTMs outperform other network architectures that have previously been used to model similar wildland fire dynamics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[37] Title: Data Troubles in Sentence Level Confidence Estimation for Machine Translation Abstract: The paper investigates the feasibility of confidence estimation for neural machine translation models operating at the high end of the performance spectrum. As a side product of the data annotation process necessary for building such models we propose sentence level accuracy $SACC$ as a simple, self-explanatory evaluation metric for quality of translation. Experiments on two different annotator pools, one comprised of non-expert (crowd-sourced) and one of expert (professional) translators show that $SACC$ can vary greatly depending on the translation proficiency of the annotators, despite the fact that both pools are about equally reliable according to Krippendorff\\'s alpha metric; the relatively low values of inter-annotator agreement confirm the expectation that sentence-level binary labeling $good$ / $needs\\\\ work$ for translation out of context is very hard. For an English-Spanish translation model operating at $SACC = 0.89$ according to a non-expert annotator pool we can derive a confidence estimate that labels 0.5-0.6 of the $good$ translations in an \"in-domain\" test set with 0.95 Precision. Switching to an expert annotator pool decreases $SACC$ dramatically: $0.61$ for English-Spanish, measured on the exact same data as above. This forces us to lower the CE model operating point to 0.9 Precision while labeling correctly about 0.20-0.25 of the $good$ translations in the data. We find surprising the extent to which CE depends on the level of proficiency of the annotator pool used for labeling the data. This leads to an important recommendation we wish to make when tackling CE modeling in practice: it is critical to match the end-user expectation for translation quality in the desired domain with the demands of annotators assigning binary quality labels to CE training data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[38] Title: ICDAR 2021 Competition on Components Segmentation Task of Document Photos Abstract: This paper describes the short-term competition on the Components Segmentation Task of Document Photos that was prepared in the context of the 16th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR 2021). This competition aims to bring together researchers working in the field of identification document image processing and provides them a suitable benchmark to compare their techniques on the component segmentation task of document images. Three challenge tasks were proposed entailing different segmentation assignments to be performed on a provided dataset. The collected data are from several types of Brazilian ID documents, whose personal information was conveniently replaced. There were 16 participants whose results obtained for some or all the three tasks show different rates for the adopted metrics, like Dice Similarity Coefficient ranging from 0.06 to 0.99. Different Deep Learning models were applied by the entrants with diverse strategies to achieve the best results in each of the tasks. Obtained results show that the currently applied methods for solving one of the proposed tasks (document boundary detection) are already well established. However, for the other two challenge tasks (text zone and handwritten sign detection) research and development of more robust approaches are still required to achieve acceptable results.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[39] Title: Efficient sign language recognition system and dataset creation method based on deep learning and image processing Abstract: New deep-learning architectures are created every year, achieving state-of-the-art results in image recognition and leading to the belief that, in a few years, complex tasks such as sign language translation will be considerably easier, serving as a communication tool for the hearing-impaired community. On the other hand, these algorithms still need a lot of data to be trained and the dataset creation process is expensive, time-consuming, and slow. Thereby, this work aims to investigate techniques of digital image processing and machine learning that can be used to create a sign language dataset effectively. We argue about data acquisition, such as the frames per second rate to capture or subsample the videos, the background type, preprocessing, and data augmentation, using convolutional neural networks and object detection to create an image classifier and comparing the results based on statistical tests. Different datasets were created to test the hypotheses, containing 14 words used daily and recorded by different smartphones in the RGB color system. We achieved an accuracy of 96.38% on the test set and 81.36% on the validation set containing more challenging conditions, showing that 30 FPS is the best frame rate subsample to train the classifier, geometric transformations work better than intensity transformations, and artificial background creation is not effective to model generalization. These trade-offs should be considered in future work as a cost-benefit guideline between computational cost and accuracy gain when creating a dataset and training a sign recognition model.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[40] Title: Self-Attentive Document Interaction Networks for Permutation Equivariant Ranking Abstract: How to leverage cross-document interactions to improve ranking performance is an important topic in information retrieval (IR) research. However, this topic has not been well-studied in the learning-to-rank setting and most of the existing work still treats each document independently while scoring. The recent development of deep learning shows strength in modeling complex relationships across sequences and sets. It thus motivates us to study how to leverage cross-document interactions for learning-to-rank in the deep learning framework. In this paper, we formally define the permutation-equivariance requirement for a scoring function that captures cross-document interactions. We then propose a self-attention based document interaction network and show that it satisfies the permutation-equivariant requirement, and can generate scores for document sets of varying sizes. Our proposed methods can automatically learn to capture document interactions without any auxiliary information, and can scale across large document sets. We conduct experiments on three ranking datasets: the benchmark Web30k, a Gmail search, and a Google Drive Quick Access dataset. Experimental results show that our proposed methods are both more effective and efficient than baselines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[41] Title: Towards CRISP-ML(Q): A Machine Learning Process Model with Quality Assurance Methodology Abstract: Machine learning is an established and frequently used technique in industry and academia but a standard process model to improve success and efficiency of machine learning applications is still missing. Project organizations and machine learning practitioners have a need for guidance throughout the life cycle of a machine learning application to meet business expectations. We therefore propose a process model for the development of machine learning applications, that covers six phases from defining the scope to maintaining the deployed machine learning application. The first phase combines business and data understanding as data availability oftentimes affects the feasibility of the project. The sixth phase covers state-of-the-art approaches for monitoring and maintenance of a machine learning applications, as the risk of model degradation in a changing environment is eminent. With each task of the process, we propose quality assurance methodology that is suitable to adress challenges in machine learning development that we identify in form of risks. The methodology is drawn from practical experience and scientific literature and has proven to be general and stable. The process model expands on CRISP-DM, a data mining process model that enjoys strong industry support but lacks to address machine learning specific tasks. Our work proposes an industry and application neutral process model tailored for machine learning applications with focus on technical tasks for quality assurance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[42] Title: Dating Documents using Graph Convolution Networks Abstract: Document date is essential for many important tasks, such as document retrieval, summarization, event detection, etc. While existing approaches for these tasks assume accurate knowledge of the document date, this is not always available, especially for arbitrary documents from the Web. Document Dating is a challenging problem which requires inference over the temporal structure of the document. Prior document dating systems have largely relied on handcrafted features while ignoring such document internal structures. In this paper, we propose NeuralDater, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based document dating approach which jointly exploits syntactic and temporal graph structures of document in a principled way. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning for the problem of document dating. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we find that NeuralDater significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline by 19% absolute (45% relative) accuracy points.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[43] Title: DeepScanner: a Robotic System for Automated 2D Object Dataset Collection with Annotations Abstract: In the proposed study, we describe the possibility of automated dataset collection using an articulated robot. The proposed technology reduces the number of pixel errors on a polygonal dataset and the time spent on manual labeling of 2D objects. The paper describes a novel automatic dataset collection and annotation system, and compares the results of automated and manual dataset labeling. Our approach increases the speed of data labeling 240-fold, and improves the accuracy compared to manual labeling 13-fold. We also present a comparison of metrics for training a neural network on a manually annotated and an automatically collected dataset.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[44] Title: Continuous Lyapunov Controller and Chaotic Non-linear System Optimization using Deep Machine Learning Abstract: The introduction of unexpected system disturbances and new system dynamics does not allow guaranteed continuous system stability. In this research we present a novel approach for detecting early failure indicators of non-linear highly chaotic system and accordingly predict the best parameter calibrations to offset such instability using deep machine learning regression model. The approach proposed continuously monitors the system and controller signals. The Re-calibration of the system and controller parameters is triggered according to a set of conditions designed to maintain system stability without compromise to the system speed, intended outcome or required processing power. The deep neural model predicts the parameter values that would best counteract the expected system in-stability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is applied to the non-linear complex combination of Duffing Van der pol oscillators. The approach is also tested under different scenarios the system and controller parameters are initially chosen incorrectly or the system parameters are changed while running or new system dynamics are introduced while running to measure effectiveness and reaction time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[45] Title: Learning to See by Looking at Noise Abstract: Current vision systems are trained on huge datasets, and these datasets come with costs: curation is expensive, they inherit human biases, and there are concerns over privacy and usage rights. To counter these costs, interest has surged in learning from cheaper data sources, such as unlabeled images. In this paper we go a step further and ask if we can do away with real image datasets entirely, instead learning from noise processes. We investigate a suite of image generation models that produce images from simple random processes. These are then used as training data for a visual representation learner with a contrastive loss. We study two types of noise processes, statistical image models and deep generative models under different random initializations. Our findings show that it is important for the noise to capture certain structural properties of real data but that good performance can be achieved even with processes that are far from realistic. We also find that diversity is a key property to learn good representations. Datasets, models, and code are available at https://mbaradad.github.io/learning_with_noise.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[46] Title: Using anomaly detection to support classification of fast running (packaging) processes Abstract: In this paper we propose a new method to assist in labeling data arriving from fast running processes using anomaly detection. A result is the possibility to manually classify data arriving at a high rates to train machine learning models. To circumvent the problem of not having a real ground truth we propose specific metrics for model selection and validation of the results. The use case is taken from the food packaging industry, where processes are affected by regular but short breakdowns causing interruptions in the production process. Fast production rates make it hard for machine operators to identify the source and thus the cause of the breakdown. Self learning assistance systems can help them finding the root cause of the problem and assist the machine operator in applying lasting solutions. These learning systems need to be trained to identify reoccurring problems using data analytics. Training is not easy as the process is too fast to be manually monitored to add specific classifications on the single data points.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[47] Title: Unrepresentative video data: A review and evaluation Abstract: It is well known that the quality and quantity of training data are significant factors which affect the development and performance of machine intelligence algorithms. Without representative data, neither scientists nor algorithms would be able to accurately capture the visual details of objects, actions or scenes. An evaluation methodology which filters data quality does not yet exist, and currently, the validation of the data depends solely on human factor. This study reviews several public datasets and discusses their limitations and issues regarding quality, feasibility, adaptation and availability of training data. A simple approach to evaluate (i.e. automatically \"clean\" samples) training data is proposed with the use of real events recorded on the YouTube platform. This study focuses on action recognition data and particularly on human fall detection datasets. However, the limitations described in this paper apply in virtually all datasets.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[48] Title: Beyond Accuracy: ROI-driven Data Analytics of Empirical Data Abstract: This vision paper demonstrates that it is crucial to consider Return-on-Investment (ROI) when performing Data Analytics. Decisions on \"How much analytics is needed\"? are hard to answer. ROI could guide for decision support on the What?, How?, and How Much? analytics for a given problem. Method: The proposed conceptual framework is validated through two empirical studies that focus on requirements dependencies extraction in the Mozilla Firefox project. The two case studies are (i) Evaluation of fine-tuned BERT against Naive Bayes and Random Forest machine learners for binary dependency classification and (ii) Active Learning against passive Learning (random sampling) for REQUIRES dependency extraction. For both the cases, their analysis investment (cost) is estimated, and the achievable benefit from DA is predicted, to determine a break-even point of the investigation. Results: For the first study, fine-tuned BERT performed superior to the Random Forest, provided that more than 40% of training data is available. For the second, Active Learning achieved higher F1 accuracy within fewer iterations and higher ROI compared to Baseline (Random sampling based RF classifier). In both the studies, estimate on, How much analysis likely would pay off for the invested efforts?, was indicated by the break-even point. Conclusions: Decisions for the depth and breadth of DA of empirical data should not be made solely based on the accuracy measures. Since ROI-driven Data Analytics provides a simple yet effective direction to discover when to stop further investigation while considering the cost and value of the various types of analysis, it helps to avoid over-analyzing empirical data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[49] Title: Directly and Efficiently Optimizing Prediction Error and AUC of Linear Classifiers Abstract: The predictive quality of machine learning models is typically measured in terms of their (approximate) expected prediction error or the so-called Area Under the Curve (AUC) for a particular data distribution. However, when the models are constructed by the means of empirical risk minimization, surrogate functions such as the logistic loss are optimized instead. This is done because the empirical approximations of the expected error and AUC functions are nonconvex and nonsmooth, and more importantly have zero derivative almost everywhere. In this work, we show that in the case of linear predictors, and under the assumption that the data has normal distribution, the expected error and the expected AUC are not only smooth, but have closed form expressions, which depend on the first and second moments of the normal distribution. Hence, we derive derivatives of these two functions and use these derivatives in an optimization algorithm to directly optimize the expected error and the AUC. In the case of real data sets, the derivatives can be approximated using empirical moments. We show that even when data is not normally distributed, computed derivatives are sufficiently useful to render an efficient optimization method and high quality solutions. Thus, we propose a gradient-based optimization method for direct optimization of the prediction error and AUC. Moreover, the per-iteration complexity of the proposed algorithm has no dependence on the size of the data set, unlike those for optimizing logistic regression and all other well known empirical risk minimization problems.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[50] Title: Estimating Rationally Inattentive Utility Functions with Deep Clustering for Framing - Applications in YouTube Engagement Dynamics Abstract: We consider a framework involving behavioral economics and machine learning. Rationally inattentive Bayesian agents make decisions based on their posterior distribution, utility function and information acquisition cost Renyi divergence which generalizes Shannon mutual information). By observing these decisions, how can an observer estimate the utility function and information acquisition cost? Using deep learning, we estimate framing information (essential extrinsic features) that determines the agent\\'s attention strategy. Then we present a preference based inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to test for rational inattention: is the agent an utility maximizer, attention maximizer, and does an information cost function exist that rationalizes the data? The test imposes a Renyi mutual information constraint which impacts how the agent can select attention strategies to maximize their expected utility. The test provides constructive estimates of the utility function and information acquisition cost of the agent. We illustrate these methods on a massive YouTube dataset for characterizing the commenting behavior of users.\\n\\nYour ranking (most to least relevant):<end_of_turn>\\n<start_of_turn>model\\n[13] > [14] > [18] > [40] > [47] > [1] > [2] > [3] > [4] > [5] > [6] > [7] > [8] > [9] > [10] > [11] > [12] > [15] > [16] > [17] > [19] > [20] > [21] > [22] > [23] > [24] > [25] > [26] > [27] > [28] > [29] > [30] > [31] > [32] > [33] > [34] > [35] > [36] > [37] > [38] > [39] > [41] > [42] > [43] > [44] > [45] > [46] > [48] > [49] > [50]<end_of_turn>\\n'"

Successful innovations, though, typically require the identification and analysis of customer needs. While traditional, established need elicitation methods are time-proven and have demonstrated their capabilities to deliver valuable insights, they lack automation and scalability and, thus, are expensive and time-consuming. In this article, we propose an approach to automatically identify and quantify customer needs by utilizing a novel data source: Users voluntarily and publicly expose information about themselves via social media, as for instance Facebook or Twitter. These posts may contain valuable information about the needs, wants, and demands of their authors. We apply a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology to add design knowledge and artifacts for the digitalization of innovation processes, in particular to provide digital support for the elicitation of customer needs. We want to investigate whether automated, speedy, and scalable need elicitation from social media is feasible. We concentrate on Twitter as a data source and on e-mobility as an application domain. In a first design cycle we conceive, implement and evaluate a method to demonstrate the feasibility of identifying those social media posts that actually express customer needs. In a second cycle, we build on this artifact to additionally quantify the need information elicited, and prove its feasibility. Third, we integrate both developed methods into an end-user software artifact and test usability in an industrial use case. Thus, we add new methods for need elicitation to the body of knowledge, and introduce concrete tooling for innovation management in practice.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2] Title: Coupling the reduced-order model and the generative model for an importance sampling estimator Abstract: In this work, we develop an importance sampling estimator by coupling the reduced-order model and the generative model in a problem setting of uncertainty quantification. The target is to estimate the probability that the quantity of interest (QoI) in a complex system is beyond a given threshold. To avoid the prohibitive cost of sampling a large scale system, the reduced-order model is usually considered for a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. However, the Monte Carlo estimator given by the reduced-order model is biased due to the error from dimension reduction. To correct the bias, we still need to sample the fine model. An effective technique to reduce the variance reduction is importance sampling, where we employ the generative model to estimate the distribution of the data from the reduced-order model and use it for the change of measure in the importance sampling estimator. To compensate the approximation errors of the reduced-order model, more data that induce a slightly smaller QoI than the threshold need to be included into the training set. Although the amount of these data can be controlled by a posterior error estimate, redundant data, which may outnumber the effective data, will be kept due to the epistemic uncertainty. To deal with this issue, we introduce a weighted empirical distribution to process the data from the reduced-order model. The generative model is then trained by minimizing the cross entropy between it and the weighted empirical distribution. We also introduce a penalty term into the objective function to deal with the overfitting for more robustness. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[3] Title: Convolutional LSTM Neural Networks for Modeling Wildland Fire Dynamics Abstract: As the climate changes, the severity of wildland fires is expected to worsen. Models that accurately capture fire propagation dynamics greatly help efforts for understanding, responding to and mitigating the damages caused by these fires. Machine learning techniques provide a potential approach for developing such models. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) recurrent neural network to model the dynamics of wildland fire propagation. The machine learning model is trained on simulated wildfire data generated by a mathematical analogue model. Three simulated datasets are analyzed, each with increasing degrees of complexity. The simplest dataset includes a constant wind direction as a single confounding factor, whereas the most complex dataset includes dynamic wind, complex terrain, spatially varying moisture content and heterogenous vegetation density distributions. We examine how effective the ConvLSTM can learn the fire-spread dynamics over consecutive time steps. It is shown that ConvLSTMs can capture local fire transmission events, as well as the overall fire dynamics, such as the rate at which the fire spreads. Finally, we demonstrate that ConvLSTMs outperform other network architectures that have previously been used to model similar wildland fire dynamics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[4] Title: Learning Transport Processes with Machine Intelligence Abstract: We present a machine learning based approach to address the study of transport processes, ubiquitous in continuous mechanics, with particular attention to those phenomena ruled by complex micro-physics, impractical to theoretical investigation, yet exhibiting emergent behavior describable by a closed mathematical expression. Our machine learning model, built using simple components and following a few well established practices, is capable of learning latent representations of the transport process substantially closer to the ground truth than expected from the nominal error characterising the data, leading to sound generalisation properties. This is demonstrated through an idealized study of the long standing problem of heat flux suppression relevant to fusion and cosmic plasmas. Our analysis shows that the result applies beyond those case specific assumptions and that, in particular, the accuracy of the learned representation is controllable through knowledge of the data quality (error properties) and a suitable choice of the dataset size. While the learned representation can be used as a plug-in for numerical modeling purposes, it can also be leveraged with the above error analysis to obtain reliable mathematical expressions describing the transport mechanism and of great theoretical value.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[5] Title: DISCO: Influence Maximization Meets Network Embedding and Deep Learning Abstract: Since its introduction in 2003, the influence maximization (IM) problem has drawn significant research attention in the literature. The aim of IM is to select a set of k users who can influence the most individuals in the social network. The problem is proven to be NP-hard. A large number of approximate algorithms have been proposed to address this problem. The state-of-the-art algorithms estimate the expected influence of nodes based on sampled diffusion paths. As the number of required samples have been recently proven to be lower bounded by a particular threshold that presets tradeoff between the accuracy and efficiency, the result quality of these traditional solutions is hard to be further improved without sacrificing efficiency. In this paper, we present an orthogonal and novel paradigm to address the IM problem by leveraging deep learning models to estimate the expected influence. Specifically, we present a novel framework called DISCO that incorporates network embedding and deep reinforcement learning techniques to address this problem. Experimental study on real-world networks demonstrates that DISCO achieves the best performance w.r.t efficiency and influence spread quality compared to state-of-the-art classical solutions. Besides, we also show that the learning model exhibits good generality.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[6] Title: Towards a Multi-modal, Multi-task Learning based Pre-training Framework for Document Representation Learning Abstract: Recent approaches in literature have exploited the multi-modal information in documents (text, layout, image) to serve specific downstream document tasks. However, they are limited by their - (i) inability to learn cross-modal representations across text, layout and image dimensions for documents and (ii) inability to process multi-page documents. Pre-training techniques have been shown in Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain to learn generic textual representations from large unlabelled datasets, applicable to various downstream NLP tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning-based framework that utilizes a combination of self-supervised and supervised pre-training tasks to learn a generic document representation applicable to various downstream document tasks. Specifically, we introduce Document Topic Modelling and Document Shuffle Prediction as novel pre-training tasks to learn rich image representations along with the text and layout representations for documents. We utilize the Longformer network architecture as the backbone to encode the multi-modal information from multi-page documents in an end-to-end fashion. We showcase the applicability of our pre-training framework on a variety of different real-world document tasks such as document classification, document information extraction, and document retrieval. We evaluate our framework on different standard document datasets and conduct exhaustive experiments to compare performance against various ablations of our framework and state-of-the-art baselines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[7] Title: AI Ethics Statements -- Analysis and lessons learnt from NeurIPS Broader Impact Statements Abstract: Ethics statements have been proposed as a mechanism to increase transparency and promote reflection on the societal impacts of published research. In 2020, the machine learning (ML) conference NeurIPS broke new ground by requiring that all papers include a broader impact statement. This requirement was removed in 2021, in favour of a checklist approach. The 2020 statements therefore provide a unique opportunity to learn from the broader impact experiment: to investigate the benefits and challenges of this and similar governance mechanisms, as well as providing an insight into how ML researchers think about the societal impacts of their own work. Such learning is needed as NeurIPS and other venues continue to question and adapt their policies. To enable this, we have created a dataset containing the impact statements from all NeurIPS 2020 papers, along with additional information such as affiliation type, location and subject area, and a simple visualisation tool for exploration. We also provide an initial quantitative analysis of the dataset, covering representation, engagement, common themes, and willingness to discuss potential harms alongside benefits. We investigate how these vary by geography, affiliation type and subject area. Drawing on these findings, we discuss the potential benefits and negative outcomes of ethics statement requirements, and their possible causes and associated challenges. These lead us to several lessons to be learnt from the 2020 requirement: (i) the importance of creating the right incentives, (ii) the need for clear expectations and guidance, and (iii) the importance of transparency and constructive deliberation. We encourage other researchers to use our dataset to provide additional analysis, to further our understanding of how researchers responded to this requirement, and to investigate the benefits and challenges of this and related mechanisms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[8] Title: Cost-Sensitive Feature-Value Acquisition Using Feature Relevance Abstract: In many real-world machine learning problems, feature values are not readily available. To make predictions, some of the missing features have to be acquired, which can incur a cost in money, computational time, or human time, depending on the problem domain. This leads us to the problem of choosing which features to use at the prediction time. The chosen features should increase the prediction accuracy for a low cost, but determining which features will do that is challenging. The choice should take into account the previously acquired feature values as well as the feature costs. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this problem. The proposed approach chooses the most useful features adaptively based on how relevant they are for the prediction task as well as what the corresponding feature costs are. Our approach uses a generic neural network architecture, which is suitable for a wide range of problems. We evaluate our approach on three cost-sensitive datasets, including Yahoo! Learning to Rank Competition dataset as well as two health datasets. We show that our approach achieves high accuracy with a lower cost than the current state-of-the-art approaches.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[9] Title: Quality Estimation of English-Hindi Outputs using Naive Bayes Classifier Abstract: In this paper we present an approach for estimating the quality of machine translation system. There are various methods for estimating the quality of output sentences, but in this paper we focus on Na\\\\\"ive Bayes classifier to build model using features which are extracted from the input sentences. These features are used for finding the likelihood of each of the sentences of the training data which are then further used for determining the scores of the test data. On the basis of these scores we determine the class labels of the test data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[10] Title: Beyond Average Performance -- exploring regions of deviating performance for black box classification models Abstract: Machine learning models are becoming increasingly popular in different types of settings. This is mainly caused by their ability to achieve a level of predictive performance that is hard to match by human experts in this new era of big data. With this usage growth comes an increase of the requirements for accountability and understanding of the models\\' predictions. However, the degree of sophistication of the most successful models (e.g. ensembles, deep learning) is becoming a large obstacle to this endeavour as these models are essentially black boxes. In this paper we describe two general approaches that can be used to provide interpretable descriptions of the expected performance of any black box classification model. These approaches are of high practical relevance as they provide means to uncover and describe in an interpretable way situations where the models are expected to have a performance that deviates significantly from their average behaviour. This may be of critical relevance for applications where costly decisions are driven by the predictions of the models, as it can be used to warn end users against the usage of the models in some specific cases.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[11] Title: Use Of Vapnik-Chervonenkis Dimension in Model Selection Abstract: In this dissertation, I derive a new method to estimate the Vapnik-Chervonenkis Dimension (VCD) for the class of linear functions. This method is inspired by the technique developed by Vapnik et al. Vapnik et al. (1994). My contribution rests on the approximation of the expected maximum difference between two empirical Losses (EMDBTEL). In fact, I use a cross-validated form of the error to compute the EMDBTEL, and I make the bound on the EMDBTEL tighter by minimizing a constant in of its right upper bound. I also derive two bounds for the true unknown risk using the additive (ERM1) and the multiplicative (ERM2) Chernoff bounds. These bounds depend on the estimated VCD and the empirical risk. These bounds can be used to perform model selection and to declare with high probability, the chosen model will perform better without making strong assumptions about the data generating process (DG). I measure the accuracy of my technique on simulated datasets and also on three real datasets. The model selection provided by VCD was always as good as if not better than the other methods under reasonable conditions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[12] Title: Benchmarking Processor Performance by Multi-Threaded Machine Learning Algorithms Abstract: Machine learning algorithms have enabled computers to predict things by learning from previous data. The data storage and processing power are increasing rapidly, thus increasing machine learning and Artificial intelligence applications. Much of the work is done to improve the accuracy of the models built in the past, with little research done to determine the computational costs of machine learning acquisitions. In this paper, I will proceed with this later research work and will make a performance comparison of multi-threaded machine learning clustering algorithms. I will be working on Linear Regression, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors to determine the performance characteristics of the algorithms as well as the computation costs to the obtained results. I will be benchmarking system hardware performance by running these multi-threaded algorithms to train and test the models on a dataset to note the differences in performance matrices of the algorithms. In the end, I will state the best performing algorithms concerning the performance efficiency of these algorithms on my system.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[13] Title: Zero-Shot Open-Book Question Answering Abstract: Open book question answering is a subset of question answering tasks where the system aims to find answers in a given set of documents (open-book) and common knowledge about a topic. This article proposes a solution for answering natural language questions from a corpus of Amazon Web Services (AWS) technical documents with no domain-specific labeled data (zero-shot). These questions can have yes-no-none answers, short answers, long answers, or any combination of the above. This solution comprises a two-step architecture in which a retriever finds the right document and an extractor finds the answers in the retrieved document. We are introducing a new test dataset for open-book QA based on real customer questions on AWS technical documentation. After experimenting with several information retrieval systems and extractor models based on extractive language models, the solution attempts to find the yes-no-none answers and text answers in the same pass. The model is trained on the The Stanford Question Answering Dataset - SQuAD (Rajpurkaret al., 2016) and Natural Questions (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019) datasets. We were able to achieve 49% F1 and 39% exact match score (EM) end-to-end with no domain-specific training.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[14] Title: What is the Value of Data? On Mathematical Methods for Data Quality Estimation Abstract: Data is one of the most important assets of the information age, and its societal impact is undisputed. Yet, rigorous methods of assessing the quality of data are lacking. In this paper, we propose a formal definition for the quality of a given dataset. We assess a dataset\\'s quality by a quantity we call the expected diameter, which measures the expected disagreement between two randomly chosen hypotheses that explain it, and has recently found applications in active learning. We focus on Boolean hyperplanes, and utilize a collection of Fourier analytic, algebraic, and probabilistic methods to come up with theoretical guarantees and practical solutions for the computation of the expected diameter. We also study the behaviour of the expected diameter on algebraically structured datasets, conduct experiments that validate this notion of quality, and demonstrate the feasibility of our techniques.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[15] Title: Enabling Smart Data: Noise filtering in Big Data classification Abstract: In any knowledge discovery process the value of extracted knowledge is directly related to the quality of the data used. Big Data problems, generated by massive growth in the scale of data observed in recent years, also follow the same dictate. A common problem affecting data quality is the presence of noise, particularly in classification problems, where label noise refers to the incorrect labeling of training instances, and is known to be a very disruptive feature of data. However, in this Big Data era, the massive growth in the scale of the data poses a challenge to traditional proposals created to tackle noise, as they have difficulties coping with such a large amount of data. New algorithms need to be proposed to treat the noise in Big Data problems, providing high quality and clean data, also known as Smart Data. In this paper, two Big Data preprocessing approaches to remove noisy examples are proposed: an homogeneous ensemble and an heterogeneous ensemble filter, with special emphasis in their scalability and performance traits. The obtained results show that these proposals enable the practitioner to efficiently obtain a Smart Dataset from any Big Data classification problem.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[16] Title: Automated Machine Learning: State-of-The-Art and Open Challenges Abstract: With the continuous and vast increase in the amount of data in our digital world, it has been acknowledged that the number of knowledgeable data scientists can not scale to address these challenges. Thus, there was a crucial need for automating the process of building good machine learning models. In the last few years, several techniques and frameworks have been introduced to tackle the challenge of automating the process of Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyper-parameter tuning (CASH) in the machine learning domain. The main aim of these techniques is to reduce the role of the human in the loop and fill the gap for non-expert machine learning users by playing the role of the domain expert. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey for the state-of-the-art efforts in tackling the CASH problem. In addition, we highlight the research work of automating the other steps of the full complex machine learning pipeline (AutoML) from data understanding till model deployment. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive coverage for the various tools and frameworks that have been introduced in this domain. Finally, we discuss some of the research directions and open challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve the vision and goals of the AutoML process.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[17] Title: An Empirical Study on the Intrinsic Privacy of SGD Abstract: Introducing noise in the training of machine learning systems is a powerful way to protect individual privacy via differential privacy guarantees, but comes at a cost to utility. This work looks at whether the inherent randomness of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) could contribute to privacy, effectively reducing the amount of \\\\emph{additional} noise required to achieve a given privacy guarantee. We conduct a large-scale empirical study to examine this question. Training a grid of over 120,000 models across four datasets (tabular and images) on convex and non-convex objectives, we demonstrate that the random seed has a larger impact on model weights than any individual training example. We test the distribution over weights induced by the seed, finding that the simple convex case can be modelled with a multivariate Gaussian posterior, while neural networks exhibit multi-modal and non-Gaussian weight distributions. By casting convex SGD as a Gaussian mechanism, we then estimate an `intrinsic\\' data-dependent $\\\\epsilon_i(\\\\mathcal{D})$, finding values as low as 6.3, dropping to 1.9 using empirical estimates. We use a membership inference attack to estimate $\\\\epsilon$ for non-convex SGD and demonstrate that hiding the random seed from the adversary results in a statistically significant reduction in attack performance, corresponding to a reduction in the effective $\\\\epsilon$. These results provide empirical evidence that SGD exhibits appreciable variability relative to its dataset sensitivity, and this `intrinsic noise\\' has the potential to be leveraged to improve the utility of privacy-preserving machine learning.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[18] Title: Online Model Selection: a Rested Bandit Formulation Abstract: Motivated by a natural problem in online model selection with bandit information, we introduce and analyze a best arm identification problem in the rested bandit setting, wherein arm expected losses decrease with the number of times the arm has been played. The shape of the expected loss functions is similar across arms, and is assumed to be available up to unknown parameters that have to be learned on the fly. We define a novel notion of regret for this problem, where we compare to the policy that always plays the arm having the smallest expected loss at the end of the game. We analyze an arm elimination algorithm whose regret vanishes as the time horizon increases. The actual rate of convergence depends in a detailed way on the postulated functional form of the expected losses. Unlike known model selection efforts in the recent bandit literature, our algorithm exploits the specific structure of the problem to learn the unknown parameters of the expected loss function so as to identify the best arm as quickly as possible. We complement our analysis with a lower bound, indicating strengths and limitations of the proposed solution.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[19] Title: Data Collection and Quality Challenges in Deep Learning: A Data-Centric AI Perspective Abstract: Data-centric AI is at the center of a fundamental shift in software engineering where machine learning becomes the new software, powered by big data and computing infrastructure. Here software engineering needs to be re-thought where data becomes a first-class citizen on par with code. One striking observation is that a significant portion of the machine learning process is spent on data preparation. Without good data, even the best machine learning algorithms cannot perform well. As a result, data-centric AI practices are now becoming mainstream. Unfortunately, many datasets in the real world are small, dirty, biased, and even poisoned. In this survey, we study the research landscape for data collection and data quality primarily for deep learning applications. Data collection is important because there is lesser need for feature engineering for recent deep learning approaches, but instead more need for large amounts of data. For data quality, we study data validation, cleaning, and integration techniques. Even if the data cannot be fully cleaned, we can still cope with imperfect data during model training using robust model training techniques. In addition, while bias and fairness have been less studied in traditional data management research, these issues become essential topics in modern machine learning applications. We thus study fairness measures and unfairness mitigation techniques that can be applied before, during, or after model training. We believe that the data management community is well poised to solve these problems.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[20] Title: Tutorial: Safe and Reliable Machine Learning Abstract: This document serves as a brief overview of the \"Safe and Reliable Machine Learning\" tutorial given at the 2019 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT* 2019).

Rationally inattentive Bayesian agents make decisions based on their posterior distribution, utility function and information acquisition cost Renyi divergence which generalizes Shannon mutual information). By observing these decisions, how can an observer estimate the utility function and information acquisition cost? Using deep learning, we estimate framing information (essential extrinsic features) that determines the agent\\'s attention strategy. Then we present a preference based inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to test for rational inattention: is the agent an utility maximizer, attention maximizer, and does an information cost function exist that rationalizes the data? The test imposes a Renyi mutual information constraint which impacts how the agent can select attention strategies to maximize their expected utility. The test provides constructive estimates of the utility function and information acquisition cost of the agent. We illustrate these methods on a massive YouTube dataset for characterizing the commenting behavior of users.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[22] Title: Content-based similar document image retrieval using fusion of CNN features Abstract: Rapid increase of digitized document give birth to high demand of document image retrieval. While conventional document image retrieval approaches depend on complex OCR-based text recognition and text similarity detection, this paper proposes a new content-based approach, in which more attention is paid to features extraction and fusion. In the proposed approach, multiple features of document images are extracted by different CNN models. After that, the extracted CNN features are reduced and fused into weighted average feature. Finally, the document images are ranked based on feature similarity to a provided query image. Experimental procedure is performed on a group of document images that transformed from academic papers, which contain both English and Chinese document, the results show that the proposed approach has good ability to retrieve document images with similar text content, and the fusion of CNN features can effectively improve the retrieval accuracy.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[23] Title: ICDAR 2021 Competition on Components Segmentation Task of Document Photos Abstract: This paper describes the short-term competition on the Components Segmentation Task of Document Photos that was prepared in the context of the 16th International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR 2021). This competition aims to bring together researchers working in the field of identification document image processing and provides them a suitable benchmark to compare their techniques on the component segmentation task of document images. Three challenge tasks were proposed entailing different segmentation assignments to be performed on a provided dataset. The collected data are from several types of Brazilian ID documents, whose personal information was conveniently replaced. There were 16 participants whose results obtained for some or all the three tasks show different rates for the adopted metrics, like Dice Similarity Coefficient ranging from 0.06 to 0.99. Different Deep Learning models were applied by the entrants with diverse strategies to achieve the best results in each of the tasks. Obtained results show that the currently applied methods for solving one of the proposed tasks (document boundary detection) are already well established. However, for the other two challenge tasks (text zone and handwritten sign detection) research and development of more robust approaches are still required to achieve acceptable results.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[24] Title: Sequential Neural Processes Abstract: Neural Processes combine the strengths of neural networks and Gaussian processes to achieve both flexible learning and fast prediction in stochastic processes. However, a large class of problems comprises underlying temporal dependency structures in a sequence of stochastic processes that Neural Processes (NP) do not explicitly consider. In this paper, we propose Sequential Neural Processes (SNP) which incorporates a temporal state-transition model of stochastic processes and thus extends its modeling capabilities to dynamic stochastic processes. In applying SNP to dynamic 3D scene modeling, we introduce the Temporal Generative Query Networks. To our knowledge, this is the first 4D model that can deal with the temporal dynamics of 3D scenes. In experiments, we evaluate the proposed methods in dynamic (non-stationary) regression and 4D scene inference and rendering.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[25] Title: Better Document-Level Machine Translation with Bayes\\' Rule Abstract: We show that Bayes\\' rule provides an effective mechanism for creating document translation models that can be learned from only parallel sentences and monolingual documents---a compelling benefit as parallel documents are not always available. In our formulation, the posterior probability of a candidate translation is the product of the unconditional (prior) probability of the candidate output document and the \"reverse translation probability\" of translating the candidate output back into the source language. Our proposed model uses a powerful autoregressive language model as the prior on target language documents, but it assumes that each sentence is translated independently from the target to the source language. Crucially, at test time, when a source document is observed, the document language model prior induces dependencies between the translations of the source sentences in the posterior. The model\\'s independence assumption not only enables efficient use of available data, but it additionally admits a practical left-to-right beam-search algorithm for carrying out inference. Experiments show that our model benefits from using cross-sentence context in the language model, and it outperforms existing document translation approaches.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[26] Title: Learning to See by Looking at Noise Abstract: Current vision systems are trained on huge datasets, and these datasets come with costs: curation is expensive, they inherit human biases, and there are concerns over privacy and usage rights. To counter these costs, interest has surged in learning from cheaper data sources, such as unlabeled images. In this paper we go a step further and ask if we can do away with real image datasets entirely, instead learning from noise processes. We investigate a suite of image generation models that produce images from simple random processes. These are then used as training data for a visual representation learner with a contrastive loss. We study two types of noise processes, statistical image models and deep generative models under different random initializations. Our findings show that it is important for the noise to capture certain structural properties of real data but that good performance can be achieved even with processes that are far from realistic. We also find that diversity is a key property to learn good representations. Datasets, models, and code are available at https://mbaradad.github.io/learning_with_noise.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[27] Title: Continuous Lyapunov Controller and Chaotic Non-linear System Optimization using Deep Machine Learning Abstract: The introduction of unexpected system disturbances and new system dynamics does not allow guaranteed continuous system stability. In this research we present a novel approach for detecting early failure indicators of non-linear highly chaotic system and accordingly predict the best parameter calibrations to offset such instability using deep machine learning regression model. The approach proposed continuously monitors the system and controller signals. The Re-calibration of the system and controller parameters is triggered according to a set of conditions designed to maintain system stability without compromise to the system speed, intended outcome or required processing power. The deep neural model predicts the parameter values that would best counteract the expected system in-stability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, it is applied to the non-linear complex combination of Duffing Van der pol oscillators. The approach is also tested under different scenarios the system and controller parameters are initially chosen incorrectly or the system parameters are changed while running or new system dynamics are introduced while running to measure effectiveness and reaction time.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[28] Title: Modelling and Quantifying Membership Information Leakage in Machine Learning Abstract: Machine learning models have been shown to be vulnerable to membership inference attacks, i.e., inferring whether individuals\\' data have been used for training models. The lack of understanding about factors contributing success of these attacks motivates the need for modelling membership information leakage using information theory and for investigating properties of machine learning models and training algorithms that can reduce membership information leakage. We use conditional mutual information leakage to measure the amount of information leakage from the trained machine learning model about the presence of an individual in the training dataset. We devise an upper bound for this measure of information leakage using Kullback--Leibler divergence that is more amenable to numerical computation. We prove a direct relationship between the Kullback--Leibler membership information leakage and the probability of success for a hypothesis-testing adversary examining whether a particular data record belongs to the training dataset of a machine learning model. We show that the mutual information leakage is a decreasing function of the training dataset size and the regularization weight. We also prove that, if the sensitivity of the machine learning model (defined in terms of the derivatives of the fitness with respect to model parameters) is high, more membership information is potentially leaked. This illustrates that complex models, such as deep neural networks, are more susceptible to membership inference attacks in comparison to simpler models with fewer degrees of freedom. We show that the amount of the membership information leakage is reduced by $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\log^{1/2}(\\\\delta^{-1})\\\\epsilon^{-1})$ when using Gaussian $(\\\\epsilon,\\\\delta)$-differentially-private additive noises.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[29] Title: Learning Arbitrary Quantities of Interest from Expensive Black-Box Functions through Bayesian Sequential Optimal Design Abstract: Estimating arbitrary quantities of interest (QoIs) that are non-linear operators of complex, expensive-to-evaluate, black-box functions is a challenging problem due to missing domain knowledge and finite budgets. Bayesian optimal design of experiments (BODE) is a family of methods that identify an optimal design of experiments (DOE) under different contexts, using only in a limited number of function evaluations. Under BODE methods, sequential design of experiments (SDOE) accomplishes this task by selecting an optimal sequence of experiments while using data-driven probabilistic surrogate models instead of the expensive black-box function. Probabilistic predictions from the surrogate model are used to define an information acquisition function (IAF) which quantifies the marginal value contributed or the expected information gained by a hypothetical experiment. The next experiment is selected by maximizing the IAF. A generally applicable IAF is the expected information gain (EIG) about a QoI as captured by the expectation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the predictive distribution of the QoI after doing a hypothetical experiment and the current predictive distribution about the same QoI. We model the underlying information source as a fully-Bayesian, non-stationary Gaussian process (FBNSGP), and derive an approximation of the information gain of a hypothetical experiment about an arbitrary QoI conditional on the hyper-parameters The EIG about the same QoI is estimated by sample averages to integrate over the posterior of the hyper-parameters and the potential experimental outcomes. We demonstrate the performance of our method in four numerical examples and a practical engineering problem of steel wire manufacturing. The method is compared to two classic SDOE methods: random sampling and uncertainty sampling.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[30] Title: Forward Thinking: Building Deep Random Forests Abstract: The success of deep neural networks has inspired many to wonder whether other learners could benefit from deep, layered architectures. We present a general framework called forward thinking for deep learning that generalizes the architectural flexibility and sophistication of deep neural networks while also allowing for (i) different types of learning functions in the network, other than neurons, and (ii) the ability to adaptively deepen the network as needed to improve results. This is done by training one layer at a time, and once a layer is trained, the input data are mapped forward through the layer to create a new learning problem. The process is then repeated, transforming the data through multiple layers, one at a time, rendering a new dataset, which is expected to be better behaved, and on which a final output layer can achieve good performance. In the case where the neurons of deep neural nets are replaced with decision trees, we call the result a Forward Thinking Deep Random Forest (FTDRF). We demonstrate a proof of concept by applying FTDRF on the MNIST dataset. We also provide a general mathematical formulation that allows for other types of deep learning problems to be considered.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[31] Title: Evaluating Predictive Uncertainty and Robustness to Distributional Shift Using Real World Data Abstract: Most machine learning models operate under the assumption that the training, testing and deployment data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This assumption doesn\\'t generally hold true in a natural setting. Usually, the deployment data is subject to various types of distributional shifts. The magnitude of a model\\'s performance is proportional to this shift in the distribution of the dataset. Thus it becomes necessary to evaluate a model\\'s uncertainty and robustness to distributional shifts to get a realistic estimate of its expected performance on real-world data. Present methods to evaluate uncertainty and model\\'s robustness are lacking and often fail to paint the full picture. Moreover, most analysis so far has primarily focused on classification tasks. In this paper, we propose more insightful metrics for general regression tasks using the Shifts Weather Prediction Dataset. We also present an evaluation of the baseline methods using these metrics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[32] Title: Beyond Accuracy: ROI-driven Data Analytics of Empirical Data Abstract: This vision paper demonstrates that it is crucial to consider Return-on-Investment (ROI) when performing Data Analytics. Decisions on \"How much analytics is needed\"? are hard to answer. ROI could guide for decision support on the What?, How?, and How Much? analytics for a given problem. Method: The proposed conceptual framework is validated through two empirical studies that focus on requirements dependencies extraction in the Mozilla Firefox project. The two case studies are (i) Evaluation of fine-tuned BERT against Naive Bayes and Random Forest machine learners for binary dependency classification and (ii) Active Learning against passive Learning (random sampling) for REQUIRES dependency extraction. For both the cases, their analysis investment (cost) is estimated, and the achievable benefit from DA is predicted, to determine a break-even point of the investigation. Results: For the first study, fine-tuned BERT performed superior to the Random Forest, provided that more than 40% of training data is available. For the second, Active Learning achieved higher F1 accuracy within fewer iterations and higher ROI compared to Baseline (Random sampling based RF classifier). In both the studies, estimate on, How much analysis likely would pay off for the invested efforts?, was indicated by the break-even point. Conclusions: Decisions for the depth and breadth of DA of empirical data should not be made solely based on the accuracy measures. Since ROI-driven Data Analytics provides a simple yet effective direction to discover when to stop further investigation while considering the cost and value of the various types of analysis, it helps to avoid over-analyzing empirical data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[33] Title: Robust Triple-Matrix-Recovery-Based Auto-Weighted Label Propagation for Classification Abstract: The graph-based semi-supervised label propagation algorithm has delivered impressive classification results. However, the estimated soft labels typically contain mixed signs and noise, which cause inaccurate predictions due to the lack of suitable constraints. Moreover, available methods typically calculate the weights and estimate the labels in the original input space, which typically contains noise and corruption. Thus, the en-coded similarities and manifold smoothness may be inaccurate for label estimation. In this paper, we present effective schemes for resolving these issues and propose a novel and robust semi-supervised classification algorithm, namely, the tri-ple-matrix-recovery-based robust auto-weighted label propa-gation framework (ALP-TMR). Our ALP-TMR introduces a triple matrix recovery mechanism to remove noise or mixed signs from the estimated soft labels and improve the robustness to noise and outliers in the steps of assigning weights and pre-dicting the labels simultaneously. Our method can jointly re-cover the underlying clean data, clean labels and clean weighting spaces by decomposing the original data, predicted soft labels or weights into a clean part plus an error part by fitting noise. In addition, ALP-TMR integrates the au-to-weighting process by minimizing reconstruction errors over the recovered clean data and clean soft labels, which can en-code the weights more accurately to improve both data rep-resentation and classification. By classifying samples in the recovered clean label and weight spaces, one can potentially improve the label prediction results. The results of extensive experiments demonstrated the satisfactory performance of our ALP-TMR.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[34] Title: Image Classification with Deep Learning in the Presence of Noisy Labels: A Survey Abstract: Image classification systems recently made a giant leap with the advancement of deep neural networks. However, these systems require an excessive amount of labeled data to be adequately trained. Gathering a correctly annotated dataset is not always feasible due to several factors, such as the expensiveness of the labeling process or difficulty of correctly classifying data, even for the experts. Because of these practical challenges, label noise is a common problem in real-world datasets, and numerous methods to train deep neural networks with label noise are proposed in the literature. Although deep neural networks are known to be relatively robust to label noise, their tendency to overfit data makes them vulnerable to memorizing even random noise. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the existence of label noise and develop counter algorithms to fade away its adverse effects to train deep neural networks efficiently. Even though an extensive survey of machine learning techniques under label noise exists, the literature lacks a comprehensive survey of methodologies centered explicitly around deep learning in the presence of noisy labels. This paper aims to present these algorithms while categorizing them into one of the two subgroups: noise model based and noise model free methods. Algorithms in the first group aim to estimate the noise structure and use this information to avoid the adverse effects of noisy labels. Differently, methods in the second group try to come up with inherently noise robust algorithms by using approaches like robust losses, regularizers or other learning paradigms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[35] Title: Explainable Artificial Intelligence for Process Mining: A General Overview and Application of a Novel Local Explanation Approach for Predictive Process Monitoring Abstract: The contemporary process-aware information systems possess the capabilities to record the activities generated during the process execution. To leverage these process specific fine-granular data, process mining has recently emerged as a promising research discipline. As an important branch of process mining, predictive business process management, pursues the objective to generate forward-looking, predictive insights to shape business processes. In this study, we propose a conceptual framework sought to establish and promote understanding of decision-making environment, underlying business processes and nature of the user characteristics for developing explainable business process prediction solutions. Consequently, with regard to the theoretical and practical implications of the framework, this study proposes a novel local post-hoc explanation approach for a deep learning classifier that is expected to facilitate the domain experts in justifying the model decisions. In contrary to alternative popular perturbation-based local explanation approaches, this study defines the local regions from the validation dataset by using the intermediate latent space representations learned by the deep neural networks. To validate the applicability of the proposed explanation method, the real-life process log data delivered by the Volvo IT Belgium\\'s incident management system are used.The adopted deep learning classifier achieves a good performance with the Area Under the ROC Curve of 0.94. The generated local explanations are also visualized and presented with relevant evaluation measures that are expected to increase the users\\' trust in the black-box-model.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[36] Title: Unsupposable Test-data Generation for Machine-learned Software Abstract: As for software development by machine learning, a trained model is evaluated by using part of an existing dataset as test data. However, if data with characteristics that differ from the existing data is input, the model does not always behave as expected. Accordingly, to confirm the behavior of the model more strictly, it is necessary to create data that differs from the existing data and test the model with that different data. The data to be tested includes not only data that developers can suppose (supposable data) but also data they cannot suppose (unsupposable data). To confirm the behavior of the model strictly, it is important to create as much unsupposable data as possible. In this study, therefore, a method called \"unsupposable test-data generation\" (UTG)---for giving suggestions for unsupposable data to model developers and testers---is proposed. UTG uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate unsupposable data. The unsupposable data is generated by acquiring latent values with low occurrence probability in the prior distribution of the VAE and inputting the acquired latent values into the decoder. If unsupposable data is included in the data generated by the decoder, the developer can recognize new unsupposable features by referring to the data. On the basis of those unsupposable features, the developer will be able to create other unsupposable data with the same features. The proposed UTG was applied to the MNIST dataset and the House Sales Price dataset. The results demonstrate the feasibility of UTG.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[37] Title: Improving Classification through Weak Supervision in Context-specific Conversational Agent Development for Teacher Education Abstract: Machine learning techniques applied to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) component of conversational agent development show promising results for improved accuracy and quality of feedback that a conversational agent can provide. The effort required to develop an educational scenario specific conversational agent is time consuming as it requires domain experts to label and annotate noisy data sources such as classroom videos. Previous approaches to modeling annotations have relied on labeling thousands of examples and calculating inter-annotator agreement and majority votes in order to model the necessary scenarios. This method, while proven successful, ignores individual annotator strengths in labeling a data point and under-utilizes examples that do not have a majority vote for labeling. We propose using a multi-task weak supervision method combined with active learning to address these concerns. This approach requires less labeling than traditional methods and shows significant improvements in precision, efficiency, and time-requirements than the majority vote method (Ratner 2019). We demonstrate the validity of this method on the Google Jigsaw data set and then propose a scenario to apply this method using the Instructional Quality Assessment(IQA) to define the categories for labeling. We propose using probabilistic modeling of annotator labeling to generate active learning examples to further label the data. Active learning is able to iteratively improve the training performance and accuracy of the original classification model. This approach combines state-of-the art labeling techniques of weak supervision and active learning to optimize results in the educational domain and could be further used to lessen the data requirements for expanded scenarios within the education domain through transfer learning.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[38] Title: Towards CRISP-ML(Q): A Machine Learning Process Model with Quality Assurance Methodology Abstract: Machine learning is an established and frequently used technique in industry and academia but a standard process model to improve success and efficiency of machine learning applications is still missing. Project organizations and machine learning practitioners have a need for guidance throughout the life cycle of a machine learning application to meet business expectations. We therefore propose a process model for the development of machine learning applications, that covers six phases from defining the scope to maintaining the deployed machine learning application. The first phase combines business and data understanding as data availability oftentimes affects the feasibility of the project. The sixth phase covers state-of-the-art approaches for monitoring and maintenance of a machine learning applications, as the risk of model degradation in a changing environment is eminent. With each task of the process, we propose quality assurance methodology that is suitable to adress challenges in machine learning development that we identify in form of risks. The methodology is drawn from practical experience and scientific literature and has proven to be general and stable. The process model expands on CRISP-DM, a data mining process model that enjoys strong industry support but lacks to address machine learning specific tasks. Our work proposes an industry and application neutral process model tailored for machine learning applications with focus on technical tasks for quality assurance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[39] Title: Jasmine: A New Active Learning Approach to Combat Cybercrime Abstract: Over the past decade, the advent of cybercrime has accelarated the research on cybersecurity. However, the deployment of intrusion detection methods falls short. One of the reasons for this is the lack of realistic evaluation datasets, which makes it a challenge to develop techniques and compare them. This is caused by the large amounts of effort it takes for a cyber analyst to classify network connections. This has raised the need for methods (i) that can learn from small sets of labeled data, (ii) that can make predictions on large sets of unlabeled data, and (iii) that request the label of only specially selected unlabeled data instances. Hence, Active Learning (AL) methods are of interest. These approaches choose specific unlabeled instances by a query function that are expected to improve overall classification performance. The resulting query observations are labeled by a human expert and added to the labeled set. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid AL method called Jasmine. Firstly, it determines how suitable each observation is for querying, i.e., how likely it is to enhance classification. These properties are the uncertainty score and anomaly score. Secondly, Jasmine introduces dynamic updating. This allows the model to adjust the balance between querying uncertain, anomalous and randomly selected observations. To this end, Jasmine is able to learn the best query strategy during the labeling process. This is in contrast to the other AL methods in cybersecurity that all have static, predetermined query functions. We show that dynamic updating, and therefore Jasmine, is able to consistently obtain good and more robust results than querying only uncertainties, only anomalies or a fixed combination of the two.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[40] Title: Neural Methods for Effective, Efficient, and Exposure-Aware Information Retrieval Abstract: Neural networks with deep architectures have demonstrated significant performance improvements in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The challenges in information retrieval (IR), however, are different from these other application areas. A common form of IR involves ranking of documents--or short passages--in response to keyword-based queries. Effective IR systems must deal with query-document vocabulary mismatch problem, by modeling relationships between different query and document terms and how they indicate relevance. Models should also consider lexical matches when the query contains rare terms--such as a person\\'s name or a product model number--not seen during training, and to avoid retrieving semantically related but irrelevant results. In many real-life IR tasks, the retrieval involves extremely large collections--such as the document index of a commercial Web search engine--containing billions of documents. Efficient IR methods should take advantage of specialized IR data structures, such as inverted index, to efficiently retrieve from large collections. Given an information need, the IR system also mediates how much exposure an information artifact receives by deciding whether it should be displayed, and where it should be positioned, among other results. Exposure-aware IR systems may optimize for additional objectives, besides relevance, such as parity of exposure for retrieved items and content publishers. In this thesis, we present novel neural architectures and methods motivated by the specific needs and challenges of IR tasks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[41] Title: From Data Quality to Model Quality: an Exploratory Study on Deep Learning Abstract: Nowadays, people strive to improve the accuracy of deep learning models. However, very little work has focused on the quality of data sets. In fact, data quality determines model quality. Therefore, it is important for us to make research on how data quality affects on model quality. In this paper, we mainly consider four aspects of data quality, including Dataset Equilibrium, Dataset Size, Quality of Label, Dataset Contamination. We deign experiment on MNIST and Cifar-10 and try to find out the influence the four aspects make on model quality. Experimental results show that four aspects all have decisive impact on the quality of models. It means that decrease in data quality in these aspects will reduce the accuracy of model.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[42] Title: Bridging the Gap: Machine Learning to Resolve Improperly Modeled Dynamics Abstract: We present a data-driven modeling strategy to overcome improperly modeled dynamics for systems exhibiting complex spatio-temporal behaviors. We propose a Deep Learning framework to resolve the differences between the true dynamics of the system and the dynamics given by a model of the system that is either inaccurately or inadequately described. Our machine learning strategy leverages data generated from the improper system model and observational data from the actual system to create a neural network to model the dynamics of the actual system. We evaluate the proposed framework using numerical solutions obtained from three increasingly complex dynamical systems. Our results show that our system is capable of learning a data-driven model that provides accurate estimates of the system states both in previously unobserved regions as well as for future states. Our results show the power of state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks in estimating an accurate prior of the system\\'s true dynamics that can be used for prediction up to a finite horizon.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[43] Title: Anomaly Detection Under Controlled Sensing Using Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning Abstract: We consider the problem of detecting anomalies among a given set of processes using their noisy binary sensor measurements. The noiseless sensor measurement corresponding to a normal process is 0, and the measurement is 1 if the process is anomalous. The decision-making algorithm is assumed to have no knowledge of the number of anomalous processes. The algorithm is allowed to choose a subset of the sensors at each time instant until the confidence level on the decision exceeds the desired value. Our objective is to design a sequential sensor selection policy that dynamically determines which processes to observe at each time and when to terminate the detection algorithm. The selection policy is designed such that the anomalous processes are detected with the desired confidence level while incurring minimum cost which comprises the delay in detection and the cost of sensing. We cast this problem as a sequential hypothesis testing problem within the framework of Markov decision processes, and solve it using the actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm. This deep neural network-based algorithm offers a low complexity solution with good detection accuracy. We also study the effect of statistical dependence between the processes on the algorithm performance. Through numerical experiments, we show that our algorithm is able to adapt to any unknown statistical dependence pattern of the processes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[44] Title: Using system context information to complement weakly labeled data Abstract: Real-world datasets collected with sensor networks often contain incomplete and uncertain labels as well as artefacts arising from the system environment. Complete and reliable labeling is often infeasible for large-scale and long-term sensor network deployments due to the labor and time overhead, limited availability of experts and missing ground truth. In addition, if the machine learning method used for analysis is sensitive to certain features of a deployment, labeling and learning needs to be repeated for every new deployment. To address these challenges, we propose to make use of system context information formalized in an information graph and embed it in the learning process via contrastive learning. Based on real-world data we show that this approach leads to an increased accuracy in case of weakly labeled data and leads to an increased robustness and transferability of the classifier to new sensor locations.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[45] Title: Unrepresentative video data: A review and evaluation Abstract: It is well known that the quality and quantity of training data are significant factors which affect the development and performance of machine intelligence algorithms. Without representative data, neither scientists nor algorithms would be able to accurately capture the visual details of objects, actions or scenes. An evaluation methodology which filters data quality does not yet exist, and currently, the validation of the data depends solely on human factor. This study reviews several public datasets and discusses their limitations and issues regarding quality, feasibility, adaptation and availability of training data. A simple approach to evaluate (i.e. automatically \"clean\" samples) training data is proposed with the use of real events recorded on the YouTube platform. This study focuses on action recognition data and particularly on human fall detection datasets. However, the limitations described in this paper apply in virtually all datasets.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[46] Title: A Survey on Distributed Machine Learning Abstract: The demand for artificial intelligence has grown significantly over the last decade and this growth has been fueled by advances in machine learning techniques and the ability to leverage hardware acceleration. However, in order to increase the quality of predictions and render machine learning solutions feasible for more complex applications, a substantial amount of training data is required. Although small machine learning models can be trained with modest amounts of data, the input for training larger models such as neural networks grows exponentially with the number of parameters. Since the demand for processing training data has outpaced the increase in computation power of computing machinery, there is a need for distributing the machine learning workload across multiple machines, and turning the centralized into a distributed system. These distributed systems present new challenges, first and foremost the efficient parallelization of the training process and the creation of a coherent model. This article provides an extensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in the field by outlining the challenges and opportunities of distributed machine learning over conventional (centralized) machine learning, discussing the techniques used for distributed machine learning, and providing an overview of the systems that are available.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[47] Title: Directly and Efficiently Optimizing Prediction Error and AUC of Linear Classifiers Abstract: The predictive quality of machine learning models is typically measured in terms of their (approximate) expected prediction error or the so-called Area Under the Curve (AUC) for a particular data distribution. However, when the models are constructed by the means of empirical risk minimization, surrogate functions such as the logistic loss are optimized instead. This is done because the empirical approximations of the expected error and AUC functions are nonconvex and nonsmooth, and more importantly have zero derivative almost everywhere. In this work, we show that in the case of linear predictors, and under the assumption that the data has normal distribution, the expected error and the expected AUC are not only smooth, but have closed form expressions, which depend on the first and second moments of the normal distribution. Hence, we derive derivatives of these two functions and use these derivatives in an optimization algorithm to directly optimize the expected error and the AUC. In the case of real data sets, the derivatives can be approximated using empirical moments. We show that even when data is not normally distributed, computed derivatives are sufficiently useful to render an efficient optimization method and high quality solutions. Thus, we propose a gradient-based optimization method for direct optimization of the prediction error and AUC. Moreover, the per-iteration complexity of the proposed algorithm has no dependence on the size of the data set, unlike those for optimizing logistic regression and all other well known empirical risk minimization problems.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[48] Title: A Data Quality-Driven View of MLOps Abstract: Developing machine learning models can be seen as a process similar to the one established for traditional software development. A key difference between the two lies in the strong dependency between the quality of a machine learning model and the quality of the data used to train or perform evaluations. In this work, we demonstrate how different aspects of data quality propagate through various stages of machine learning development. By performing a joint analysis of the impact of well-known data quality dimensions and the downstream machine learning process, we show that different components of a typical MLOps pipeline can be efficiently designed, providing both a technical and theoretical perspective.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[49] Title: Privacy-preserving Machine Learning through Data Obfuscation Abstract: As machine learning becomes a practice and commodity, numerous cloud-based services and frameworks are provided to help customers develop and deploy machine learning applications. While it is prevalent to outsource model training and serving tasks in the cloud, it is important to protect the privacy of sensitive samples in the training dataset and prevent information leakage to untrusted third parties. Past work have shown that a malicious machine learning service provider or end user can easily extract critical information about the training samples, from the model parameters or even just model outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic methodology to preserve the privacy of training data in machine learning applications. Specifically we introduce an obfuscate function and apply it to the training data before feeding them to the model training task. This function adds random noise to existing samples, or augments the dataset with new samples. By doing so sensitive information about the properties of individual samples, or statistical properties of a group of samples, is hidden. Meanwhile the model trained from the obfuscated dataset can still achieve high accuracy. With this approach, the customers can safely disclose the data or models to third-party providers or end users without the need to worry about data privacy. Our experiments show that this approach can effective defeat four existing types of machine learning privacy attacks at negligible accuracy cost.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[50] Title: Novel and Efficient Approximations for Zero-One Loss of Linear Classifiers Abstract: The predictive quality of machine learning models is typically measured in terms of their (approximate) expected prediction accuracy or the so-called Area Under the Curve (AUC). Minimizing the reciprocals of these measures are the goals of supervised learning. However, when the models are constructed by the means of empirical risk minimization (ERM), surrogate functions such as the logistic loss or hinge loss are optimized instead. In this work, we show that in the case of linear predictors, the expected error and the expected ranking loss can be effectively approximated by smooth functions whose closed form expressions and those of their first (and second) order derivatives depend on the first and second moments of the data distribution, which can be precomputed. Hence, the complexity of an optimization algorithm applied to these functions does not depend on the size of the training data. These approximation functions are derived under the assumption that the output of the linear classifier for a given data set has an approximately normal distribution. We argue that this assumption is significantly weaker than the Gaussian assumption on the data itself and we support this claim by demonstrating that our new approximation is quite accurate on data sets that are not necessarily Gaussian. We present computational results that show that our proposed approximations and related optimization algorithms can produce linear classifiers with similar or better test accuracy or AUC, than those obtained using state-of-the-art approaches, in a fraction of the time.\\n\\nYour ranking (most to least relevant):<end_of_turn>\\n<start_of_turn>model\\n[37] > [41] > [15] > [34] > [44] > [1] > [2] > [3] > [4] > [5] > [6] > [7] > [8] > [9] > [10] > [11] > [12] > [13] > [14] > [16] > [17] > [18] > [19] > [20] > [21] > [22] > [23] > [24] > [25] > [26] > [27] > [28] > [29] > [30] > [31] > [32] > [33] > [35] > [36] > [38] > [39] > [40] > [42] > [43] > [45] > [46] > [47] > [48] > [49] > [50]<end_of_turn>\\n',\n",

      "[1] Title: Needmining: Designing Digital Support to Elicit Needs from Social Media Abstract: Today's businesses face a high pressure to innovate in order to succeed in highly competitive markets. Successful innovations, though, typically require the identification and analysis of customer needs. While traditional, established need elicitation methods are time-proven and have demonstrated their capabilities to deliver valuable insights, they lack automation and scalability and, thus, are expensive and time-consuming. In this article, we propose an approach to automatically identify and quantify customer needs by utilizing a novel data source: Users voluntarily and publicly expose information about themselves via social media, as for instance Facebook or Twitter. These posts may contain valuable information about the needs, wants, and demands of their authors. We apply a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology to add design knowledge and artifacts for the digitalization of innovation processes, in particular to provide digital support for the elicitation of customer needs. We want to investigate whether automated, speedy, and scalable need elicitation from social media is feasible. We concentrate on Twitter as a data source and on e-mobility as an application domain. In a first design cycle we conceive, implement and evaluate a method to demonstrate the feasibility of identifying those social media posts that actually express customer needs. In a second cycle, we build on this artifact to additionally quantify the need information elicited, and prove its feasibility. Third, we integrate both developed methods into an end-user software artifact and test usability in an industrial use case. Thus, we add new methods for need elicitation to the body of knowledge, and introduce concrete tooling for innovation management in practice.\n",

The target is to estimate the probability that the quantity of interest (QoI) in a complex system is beyond a given threshold. To avoid the prohibitive cost of sampling a large scale system, the reduced-order model is usually considered for a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. However, the Monte Carlo estimator given by the reduced-order model is biased due to the error from dimension reduction. To correct the bias, we still need to sample the fine model. An effective technique to reduce the variance reduction is importance sampling, where we employ the generative model to estimate the distribution of the data from the reduced-order model and use it for the change of measure in the importance sampling estimator. To compensate the approximation errors of the reduced-order model, more data that induce a slightly smaller QoI than the threshold need to be included into the training set. Although the amount of these data can be controlled by a posterior error estimate, redundant data, which may outnumber the effective data, will be kept due to the epistemic uncertainty. To deal with this issue, we introduce a weighted empirical distribution to process the data from the reduced-order model. The generative model is then trained by minimizing the cross entropy between it and the weighted empirical distribution. We also introduce a penalty term into the objective function to deal with the overfitting for more robustness. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.\n",

      "[3] Title: Convolutional LSTM Neural Networks for Modeling Wildland Fire Dynamics Abstract: As the climate changes, the severity of wildland fires is expected to worsen. Models that accurately capture fire propagation dynamics greatly help efforts for understanding, responding to and mitigating the damages caused by these fires. Machine learning techniques provide a potential approach for developing such models. The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) recurrent neural network to model the dynamics of wildland fire propagation. The machine learning model is trained on simulated wildfire data generated by a mathematical analogue model. Three simulated datasets are analyzed, each with increasing degrees of complexity. The simplest dataset includes a constant wind direction as a single confounding factor, whereas the most complex dataset includes dynamic wind, complex terrain, spatially varying moisture content and heterogenous vegetation density distributions. We examine how effective the ConvLSTM can learn the fire-spread dynamics over consecutive time steps. It is shown that ConvLSTMs can capture local fire transmission events, as well as the overall fire dynamics, such as the rate at which the fire spreads. Finally, we demonstrate that ConvLSTMs outperform other network architectures that have previously been used to model similar wildland fire dynamics.\n",

Our machine learning model, built using simple components and following a few well established practices, is capable of learning latent representations of the transport process substantially closer to the ground truth than expected from the nominal error characterising the data, leading to sound generalisation properties. This is demonstrated through an idealized study of the long standing problem of heat flux suppression relevant to fusion and cosmic plasmas. Our analysis shows that the result applies beyond those case specific assumptions and that, in particular, the accuracy of the learned representation is controllable through knowledge of the data quality (error properties) and a suitable choice of the dataset size. While the learned representation can be used as a plug-in for numerical modeling purposes, it can also be leveraged with the above error analysis to obtain reliable mathematical expressions describing the transport mechanism and of great theoretical value.\n",

The aim of IM is to select a set of k users who can influence the most individuals in the social network. The problem is proven to be NP-hard. A large number of approximate algorithms have been proposed to address this problem. The state-of-the-art algorithms estimate the expected influence of nodes based on sampled diffusion paths. As the number of required samples have been recently proven to be lower bounded by a particular threshold that presets tradeoff between the accuracy and efficiency, the result quality of these traditional solutions is hard to be further improved without sacrificing efficiency. In this paper, we present an orthogonal and novel paradigm to address the IM problem by leveraging deep learning models to estimate the expected influence. Specifically, we present a novel framework called DISCO that incorporates network embedding and deep reinforcement learning techniques to address this problem. Experimental study on real-world networks demonstrates that DISCO achieves the best performance w.r.t efficiency and influence spread quality compared to state-of-the-art classical solutions. Besides, we also show that the learning model exhibits good generality.\n",

However, they are limited by their - (i) inability to learn cross-modal representations across text, layout and image dimensions for documents and (ii) inability to process multi-page documents. Pre-training techniques have been shown in Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain to learn generic textual representations from large unlabelled datasets, applicable to various downstream NLP tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-task learning-based framework that utilizes a combination of self-supervised and supervised pre-training tasks to learn a generic document representation applicable to various downstream document tasks. Specifically, we introduce Document Topic Modelling and Document Shuffle Prediction as novel pre-training tasks to learn rich image representations along with the text and layout representations for documents. We utilize the Longformer network architecture as the backbone to encode the multi-modal information from multi-page documents in an end-to-end fashion. We showcase the applicability of our pre-training framework on a variety of different real-world document tasks such as document classification, document information extraction, and document retrieval.

In 2020, the machine learning (ML) conference NeurIPS broke new ground by requiring that all papers include a broader impact statement. This requirement was removed in 2021, in favour of a checklist approach. The 2020 statements therefore provide a unique opportunity to learn from the broader impact experiment: to investigate the benefits and challenges of this and similar governance mechanisms, as well as providing an insight into how ML researchers think about the societal impacts of their own work. Such learning is needed as NeurIPS and other venues continue to question and adapt their policies. To enable this, we have created a dataset containing the impact statements from all NeurIPS 2020 papers, along with additional information such as affiliation type, location and subject area, and a simple visualisation tool for exploration. We also provide an initial quantitative analysis of the dataset, covering representation, engagement, common themes, and willingness to discuss potential harms alongside benefits. We investigate how these vary by geography, affiliation type and subject area. Drawing on these findings, we discuss the potential benefits and negative outcomes of ethics statement requirements, and their possible causes and associated challenges. These lead us to several lessons to be learnt from the 2020 requirement: (i) the importance of creating the right incentives, (ii) the need for clear expectations and guidance, and (iii) the importance of transparency and constructive deliberation. We encourage other researchers to use our dataset to provide additional analysis, to further our understanding of how researchers responded to this requirement, and to investigate the benefits and challenges of this and related mechanisms.\n",

To make predictions, some of the missing features have to be acquired, which can incur a cost in money, computational time, or human time, depending on the problem domain. This leads us to the problem of choosing which features to use at the prediction time. The chosen features should increase the prediction accuracy for a low cost, but determining which features will do that is challenging. The choice should take into account the previously acquired feature values as well as the feature costs. This paper proposes a novel approach to address this problem. The proposed approach chooses the most useful features adaptively based on how relevant they are for the prediction task as well as what the corresponding feature costs are. Our approach uses a generic neural network architecture, which is suitable for a wide range of problems. We evaluate our approach on three cost-sensitive datasets, including Yahoo! Learning to Rank Competition dataset as well as two health datasets. We show that our approach achieves high accuracy with a lower cost than the current state-of-the-art approaches.\n",

This is mainly caused by their ability to achieve a level of predictive performance that is hard to match by human experts in this new era of big data. With this usage growth comes an increase of the requirements for accountability and understanding of the models' predictions. However, the degree of sophistication of the most successful models (e.g. ensembles, deep learning) is becoming a large obstacle to this endeavour as these models are essentially black boxes. In this paper we describe two general approaches that can be used to provide interpretable descriptions of the expected performance of any black box classification model. These approaches are of high practical relevance as they provide means to uncover and describe in an interpretable way situations where the models are expected to have a performance that deviates significantly from their average behaviour. This may be of critical relevance for applications where costly decisions are driven by the predictions of the models, as it can be used to warn end users against the usage of the models in some specific cases.\n",

This method is inspired by the technique developed by Vapnik et al. Vapnik et al. (1994). My contribution rests on the approximation of the expected maximum difference between two empirical Losses (EMDBTEL). In fact, I use a cross-validated form of the error to compute the EMDBTEL, and I make the bound on the EMDBTEL tighter by minimizing a constant in of its right upper bound. I also derive two bounds for the true unknown risk using the additive (ERM1) and the multiplicative (ERM2) Chernoff bounds. These bounds depend on the estimated VCD and the empirical risk. These bounds can be used to perform model selection and to declare with high probability, the chosen model will perform better without making strong assumptions about the data generating process (DG). I measure the accuracy of my technique on simulated datasets and also on three real datasets. The model selection provided by VCD was always as good as if not better than the other methods under reasonable conditions.\n",

Yet, rigorous methods of assessing the quality of data are lacking. In this paper, we propose a formal definition for the quality of a given dataset. We assess a dataset's quality by a quantity we call the expected diameter, which measures the expected disagreement between two randomly chosen hypotheses that explain it, and has recently found applications in active learning. We focus on Boolean hyperplanes, and utilize a collection of Fourier analytic, algebraic, and probabilistic methods to come up with theoretical guarantees and practical solutions for the computation of the expected diameter. We also study the behaviour of the expected diameter on algebraically structured datasets, conduct experiments that validate this notion of quality, and demonstrate the feasibility of our techniques.\n",

Big Data problems, generated by massive growth in the scale of data observed in recent years, also follow the same dictate. A common problem affecting data quality is the presence of noise, particularly in classification problems, where label noise refers to the incorrect labeling of training instances, and is known to be a very disruptive feature of data. However, in this Big Data era, the massive growth in the scale of the data poses a challenge to traditional proposals created to tackle noise, as they have difficulties coping with such a large amount of data. New algorithms need to be proposed to treat the noise in Big Data problems, providing high quality and clean data, also known as Smart Data. In this paper, two Big Data preprocessing approaches to remove noisy examples are proposed: an homogeneous ensemble and an heterogeneous ensemble filter, with special emphasis in their scalability and performance traits. The obtained results show that these proposals enable the practitioner to efficiently obtain a Smart Dataset from any Big Data classification problem.\n",

This work looks at whether the inherent randomness of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) could contribute to privacy, effectively reducing the amount of \\emph{additional} noise required to achieve a given privacy guarantee. We conduct a large-scale empirical study to examine this question. Training a grid of over 120,000 models across four datasets (tabular and images) on convex and non-convex objectives, we demonstrate that the random seed has a larger impact on model weights than any individual training example. We test the distribution over weights induced by the seed, finding that the simple convex case can be modelled with a multivariate Gaussian posterior, while neural networks exhibit multi-modal and non-Gaussian weight distributions. By casting convex SGD as a Gaussian mechanism, we then estimate an `intrinsic' data-dependent $\\epsilon_i(\\mathcal{D})$, finding values as low as 6.3, dropping to 1.9 using empirical estimates. We use a membership inference attack to estimate $\\epsilon$ for non-convex SGD and demonstrate that hiding the random seed from the adversary results in a statistically significant reduction in attack performance, corresponding to a reduction in the effective $\\epsilon$. These results provide empirical evidence that SGD exhibits appreciable variability relative to its dataset sensitivity, and this `intrinsic noise' has the potential to be leveraged to improve the utility of privacy-preserving machine learning.\n",

The shape of the expected loss functions is similar across arms, and is assumed to be available up to unknown parameters that have to be learned on the fly. We define a novel notion of regret for this problem, where we compare to the policy that always plays the arm having the smallest expected loss at the end of the game. We analyze an arm elimination algorithm whose regret vanishes as the time horizon increases. The actual rate of convergence depends in a detailed way on the postulated functional form of the expected losses. Unlike known model selection efforts in the recent bandit literature, our algorithm exploits the specific structure of the problem to learn the unknown parameters of the expected loss function so as to identify the best arm as quickly as possible. We complement our analysis with a lower bound, indicating strengths and limitations of the proposed solution.\n",

Here software engineering needs to be re-thought where data becomes a first-class citizen on par with code. One striking observation is that a significant portion of the machine learning process is spent on data preparation. Without good data, even the best machine learning algorithms cannot perform well. As a result, data-centric AI practices are now becoming mainstream. Unfortunately, many datasets in the real world are small, dirty, biased, and even poisoned. In this survey, we study the research landscape for data collection and data quality primarily for deep learning applications. Data collection is important because there is lesser need for feature engineering for recent deep learning approaches, but instead more need for large amounts of data. For data quality, we study data validation, cleaning, and integration techniques. Even if the data cannot be fully cleaned, we can still cope with imperfect data during model training using robust model training techniques. In addition, while bias and fairness have been less studied in traditional data management research, these issues become essential topics in modern machine learning applications. We thus study fairness measures and unfairness mitigation techniques that can be applied before, during, or after model training. We believe that the data management community is well poised to solve these problems.\n",

By observing these decisions, how can an observer estimate the utility function and information acquisition cost? Using deep learning, we estimate framing information (essential extrinsic features) that determines the agent's attention strategy. Then we present a preference based inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to test for rational inattention: is the agent an utility maximizer, attention maximizer, and does an information cost function exist that rationalizes the data? The test imposes a Renyi mutual information constraint which impacts how the agent can select attention strategies to maximize their expected utility. The test provides constructive estimates of the utility function and information acquisition cost of the agent.

In our formulation, the posterior probability of a candidate translation is the product of the unconditional (prior) probability of the candidate output document and the \"reverse translation probability\" of translating the candidate output back into the source language. Our proposed model uses a powerful autoregressive language model as the prior on target language documents, but it assumes that each sentence is translated independently from the target to the source language. Crucially, at test time, when a source document is observed, the document language model prior induces dependencies between the translations of the source sentences in the posterior. The model's independence assumption not only enables efficient use of available data, but it additionally admits a practical left-to-right beam-search algorithm for carrying out inference. Experiments show that our model benefits from using cross-sentence context in the language model, and it outperforms existing document translation approaches.\n",

To counter these costs, interest has surged in learning from cheaper data sources, such as unlabeled images. In this paper we go a step further and ask if we can do away with real image datasets entirely, instead learning from noise processes. We investigate a suite of image generation models that produce images from simple random processes. These are then used as training data for a visual representation learner with a contrastive loss. We study two types of noise processes, statistical image models and deep generative models under different random initializations. Our findings show that it is important for the noise to capture certain structural properties of real data but that good performance can be achieved even with processes that are far from realistic.

The lack of understanding about factors contributing success of these attacks motivates the need for modelling membership information leakage using information theory and for investigating properties of machine learning models and training algorithms that can reduce membership information leakage. We use conditional mutual information leakage to measure the amount of information leakage from the trained machine learning model about the presence of an individual in the training dataset. We devise an upper bound for this measure of information leakage using Kullback--Leibler divergence that is more amenable to numerical computation. We prove a direct relationship between the Kullback--Leibler membership information leakage and the probability of success for a hypothesis-testing adversary examining whether a particular data record belongs to the training dataset of a machine learning model. We show that the mutual information leakage is a decreasing function of the training dataset size and the regularization weight. We also prove that, if the sensitivity of the machine learning model (defined in terms of the derivatives of the fitness with respect to model parameters) is high, more membership information is potentially leaked. This illustrates that complex models, such as deep neural networks, are more susceptible to membership inference attacks in comparison to simpler models with fewer degrees of freedom. We show that the amount of the membership information leakage is reduced by $\\mathcal{O}(\\log^{1/2}(\\delta^{-1})\\epsilon^{-1})$ when using Gaussian $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differentially-private additive noises.\n",

Bayesian optimal design of experiments (BODE) is a family of methods that identify an optimal design of experiments (DOE) under different contexts, using only in a limited number of function evaluations. Under BODE methods, sequential design of experiments (SDOE) accomplishes this task by selecting an optimal sequence of experiments while using data-driven probabilistic surrogate models instead of the expensive black-box function. Probabilistic predictions from the surrogate model are used to define an information acquisition function (IAF) which quantifies the marginal value contributed or the expected information gained by a hypothetical experiment. The next experiment is selected by maximizing the IAF. A generally applicable IAF is the expected information gain (EIG) about a QoI as captured by the expectation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the predictive distribution of the QoI after doing a hypothetical experiment and the current predictive distribution about the same QoI. We model the underlying information source as a fully-Bayesian, non-stationary Gaussian process (FBNSGP), and derive an approximation of the information gain of a hypothetical experiment about an arbitrary QoI conditional on the hyper-parameters The EIG about the same QoI is estimated by sample averages to integrate over the posterior of the hyper-parameters and the potential experimental outcomes. We demonstrate the performance of our method in four numerical examples and a practical engineering problem of steel wire manufacturing. The method is compared to two classic SDOE methods: random sampling and uncertainty sampling.\n",

      "[30] Title: Forward Thinking: Building Deep Random Forests Abstract: The success of deep neural networks has inspired many to wonder whether other learners could benefit from deep, layered architectures. We present a general framework called forward thinking for deep learning that generalizes the architectural flexibility and sophistication of deep neural networks while also allowing for (i) different types of learning functions in the network, other than neurons, and (ii) the ability to adaptively deepen the network as needed to improve results. This is done by training one layer at a time, and once a layer is trained, the input data are mapped forward through the layer to create a new learning problem. The process is then repeated, transforming the data through multiple layers, one at a time, rendering a new dataset, which is expected to be better behaved, and on which a final output layer can achieve good performance. In the case where the neurons of deep neural nets are replaced with decision trees, we call the result a Forward Thinking Deep Random Forest (FTDRF). We demonstrate a proof of concept by applying FTDRF on the MNIST dataset. We also provide a general mathematical formulation that allows for other types of deep learning problems to be considered.\n",

      "[31] Title: Evaluating Predictive Uncertainty and Robustness to Distributional Shift Using Real World Data Abstract: Most machine learning models operate under the assumption that the training, testing and deployment data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This assumption doesn't generally hold true in a natural setting. Usually, the deployment data is subject to various types of distributional shifts. The magnitude of a model's performance is proportional to this shift in the distribution of the dataset. Thus it becomes necessary to evaluate a model's uncertainty and robustness to distributional shifts to get a realistic estimate of its expected performance on real-world data. Present methods to evaluate uncertainty and model's robustness are lacking and often fail to paint the full picture. Moreover, most analysis so far has primarily focused on classification tasks. In this paper, we propose more insightful metrics for general regression tasks using the Shifts Weather Prediction Dataset. We also present an evaluation of the baseline methods using these metrics.\n",

Decisions on \"How much analytics is needed\"? are hard to answer. ROI could guide for decision support on the What?, How?, and How Much? analytics for a given problem. Method: The proposed conceptual framework is validated through two empirical studies that focus on requirements dependencies extraction in the Mozilla Firefox project. The two case studies are (i) Evaluation of fine-tuned BERT against Naive Bayes and Random Forest machine learners for binary dependency classification and (ii) Active Learning against passive Learning (random sampling) for REQUIRES dependency extraction. For both the cases, their analysis investment (cost) is estimated, and the achievable benefit from DA is predicted, to determine a break-even point of the investigation. Results: For the first study, fine-tuned BERT performed superior to the Random Forest, provided that more than 40% of training data is available. For the second, Active Learning achieved higher F1 accuracy within fewer iterations and higher ROI compared to Baseline (Random sampling based RF classifier). In both the studies, estimate on, How much analysis likely would pay off for the invested efforts?, was indicated by the break-even point. Conclusions: Decisions for the depth and breadth of DA of empirical data should not be made solely based on the accuracy measures. Since ROI-driven Data Analytics provides a simple yet effective direction to discover when to stop further investigation while considering the cost and value of the various types of analysis, it helps to avoid over-analyzing empirical data.\n",

      "[33] Title: Robust Triple-Matrix-Recovery-Based Auto-Weighted Label Propagation for Classification Abstract: The graph-based semi-supervised label propagation algorithm has delivered impressive classification results. However, the estimated soft labels typically contain mixed signs and noise, which cause inaccurate predictions due to the lack of suitable constraints. Moreover, available methods typically calculate the weights and estimate the labels in the original input space, which typically contains noise and corruption. Thus, the en-coded similarities and manifold smoothness may be inaccurate for label estimation. In this paper, we present effective schemes for resolving these issues and propose a novel and robust semi-supervised classification algorithm, namely, the tri-ple-matrix-recovery-based robust auto-weighted label propa-gation framework (ALP-TMR). Our ALP-TMR introduces a triple matrix recovery mechanism to remove noise or mixed signs from the estimated soft labels and improve the robustness to noise and outliers in the steps of assigning weights and pre-dicting the labels simultaneously. Our method can jointly re-cover the underlying clean data, clean labels and clean weighting spaces by decomposing the original data, predicted soft labels or weights into a clean part plus an error part by fitting noise. In addition, ALP-TMR integrates the au-to-weighting process by minimizing reconstruction errors over the recovered clean data and clean soft labels, which can en-code the weights more accurately to improve both data rep-resentation and classification. By classifying samples in the recovered clean label and weight spaces, one can potentially improve the label prediction results. The results of extensive experiments demonstrated the satisfactory performance of our ALP-TMR.\n",

      "[34] Title: Image Classification with Deep Learning in the Presence of Noisy Labels: A Survey Abstract: Image classification systems recently made a giant leap with the advancement of deep neural networks. However, these systems require an excessive amount of labeled data to be adequately trained. Gathering a correctly annotated dataset is not always feasible due to several factors, such as the expensiveness of the labeling process or difficulty of correctly classifying data, even for the experts. Because of these practical challenges, label noise is a common problem in real-world datasets, and numerous methods to train deep neural networks with label noise are proposed in the literature. Although deep neural networks are known to be relatively robust to label noise, their tendency to overfit data makes them vulnerable to memorizing even random noise. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the existence of label noise and develop counter algorithms to fade away its adverse effects to train deep neural networks efficiently. Even though an extensive survey of machine learning techniques under label noise exists, the literature lacks a comprehensive survey of methodologies centered explicitly around deep learning in the presence of noisy labels. This paper aims to present these algorithms while categorizing them into one of the two subgroups: noise model based and noise model free methods. Algorithms in the first group aim to estimate the noise structure and use this information to avoid the adverse effects of noisy labels. Differently, methods in the second group try to come up with inherently noise robust algorithms by using approaches like robust losses, regularizers or other learning paradigms.\n",

To leverage these process specific fine-granular data, process mining has recently emerged as a promising research discipline. As an important branch of process mining, predictive business process management, pursues the objective to generate forward-looking, predictive insights to shape business processes. In this study, we propose a conceptual framework sought to establish and promote understanding of decision-making environment, underlying business processes and nature of the user characteristics for developing explainable business process prediction solutions. Consequently, with regard to the theoretical and practical implications of the framework, this study proposes a novel local post-hoc explanation approach for a deep learning classifier that is expected to facilitate the domain experts in justifying the model decisions. In contrary to alternative popular perturbation-based local explanation approaches, this study defines the local regions from the validation dataset by using the intermediate latent space representations learned by the deep neural networks. To validate the applicability of the proposed explanation method, the real-life process log data delivered by the Volvo IT Belgium's incident management system are used.The adopted deep learning classifier achieves a good performance with the Area Under the ROC Curve of 0.94. The generated local explanations are also visualized and presented with relevant evaluation measures that are expected to increase the users' trust in the black-box-model.\n",

      "[36] Title: Unsupposable Test-data Generation for Machine-learned Software Abstract: As for software development by machine learning, a trained model is evaluated by using part of an existing dataset as test data. However, if data with characteristics that differ from the existing data is input, the model does not always behave as expected. Accordingly, to confirm the behavior of the model more strictly, it is necessary to create data that differs from the existing data and test the model with that different data. The data to be tested includes not only data that developers can suppose (supposable data) but also data they cannot suppose (unsupposable data). To confirm the behavior of the model strictly, it is important to create as much unsupposable data as possible. In this study, therefore, a method called \"unsupposable test-data generation\" (UTG)---for giving suggestions for unsupposable data to model developers and testers---is proposed. UTG uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) to generate unsupposable data. The unsupposable data is generated by acquiring latent values with low occurrence probability in the prior distribution of the VAE and inputting the acquired latent values into the decoder. If unsupposable data is included in the data generated by the decoder, the developer can recognize new unsupposable features by referring to the data. On the basis of those unsupposable features, the developer will be able to create other unsupposable data with the same features. The proposed UTG was applied to the MNIST dataset and the House Sales Price dataset. The results demonstrate the feasibility of UTG.\n",

      "[37] Title: Improving Classification through Weak Supervision in Context-specific Conversational Agent Development for Teacher Education Abstract: Machine learning techniques applied to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) component of conversational agent development show promising results for improved accuracy and quality of feedback that a conversational agent can provide. The effort required to develop an educational scenario specific conversational agent is time consuming as it requires domain experts to label and annotate noisy data sources such as classroom videos. Previous approaches to modeling annotations have relied on labeling thousands of examples and calculating inter-annotator agreement and majority votes in order to model the necessary scenarios. This method, while proven successful, ignores individual annotator strengths in labeling a data point and under-utilizes examples that do not have a majority vote for labeling. We propose using a multi-task weak supervision method combined with active learning to address these concerns. This approach requires less labeling than traditional methods and shows significant improvements in precision, efficiency, and time-requirements than the majority vote method (Ratner 2019). We demonstrate the validity of this method on the Google Jigsaw data set and then propose a scenario to apply this method using the Instructional Quality Assessment(IQA) to define the categories for labeling. We propose using probabilistic modeling of annotator labeling to generate active learning examples to further label the data. Active learning is able to iteratively improve the training performance and accuracy of the original classification model. This approach combines state-of-the art labeling techniques of weak supervision and active learning to optimize results in the educational domain and could be further used to lessen the data requirements for expanded scenarios within the education domain through transfer learning.\n",

Project organizations and machine learning practitioners have a need for guidance throughout the life cycle of a machine learning application to meet business expectations. We therefore propose a process model for the development of machine learning applications, that covers six phases from defining the scope to maintaining the deployed machine learning application. The first phase combines business and data understanding as data availability oftentimes affects the feasibility of the project. The sixth phase covers state-of-the-art approaches for monitoring and maintenance of a machine learning applications, as the risk of model degradation in a changing environment is eminent. With each task of the process, we propose quality assurance methodology that is suitable to adress challenges in machine learning development that we identify in form of risks. The methodology is drawn from practical experience and scientific literature and has proven to be general and stable. The process model expands on CRISP-DM, a data mining process model that enjoys strong industry support but lacks to address machine learning specific tasks.

However, the deployment of intrusion detection methods falls short. One of the reasons for this is the lack of realistic evaluation datasets, which makes it a challenge to develop techniques and compare them. This is caused by the large amounts of effort it takes for a cyber analyst to classify network connections. This has raised the need for methods (i) that can learn from small sets of labeled data, (ii) that can make predictions on large sets of unlabeled data, and (iii) that request the label of only specially selected unlabeled data instances. Hence, Active Learning (AL) methods are of interest. These approaches choose specific unlabeled instances by a query function that are expected to improve overall classification performance. The resulting query observations are labeled by a human expert and added to the labeled set. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid AL method called Jasmine. Firstly, it determines how suitable each observation is for querying, i.e., how likely it is to enhance classification. These properties are the uncertainty score and anomaly score. Secondly, Jasmine introduces dynamic updating. This allows the model to adjust the balance between querying uncertain, anomalous and randomly selected observations. To this end, Jasmine is able to learn the best query strategy during the labeling process. This is in contrast to the other AL methods in cybersecurity that all have static, predetermined query functions. We show that dynamic updating, and therefore Jasmine, is able to consistently obtain good and more robust results than querying only uncertainties, only anomalies or a fixed combination of the two.\n",

      "[40] Title: Neural Methods for Effective, Efficient, and Exposure-Aware Information Retrieval Abstract: Neural networks with deep architectures have demonstrated significant performance improvements in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The challenges in information retrieval (IR), however, are different from these other application areas. A common form of IR involves ranking of documents--or short passages--in response to keyword-based queries. Effective IR systems must deal with query-document vocabulary mismatch problem, by modeling relationships between different query and document terms and how they indicate relevance. Models should also consider lexical matches when the query contains rare terms--such as a person's name or a product model number--not seen during training, and to avoid retrieving semantically related but irrelevant results. In many real-life IR tasks, the retrieval involves extremely large collections--such as the document index of a commercial Web search engine--containing billions of documents. Efficient IR methods should take advantage of specialized IR data structures, such as inverted index, to efficiently retrieve from large collections. Given an information need, the IR system also mediates how much exposure an information artifact receives by deciding whether it should be displayed, and where it should be positioned, among other results. Exposure-aware IR systems may optimize for additional objectives, besides relevance, such as parity of exposure for retrieved items and content publishers. In this thesis, we present novel neural architectures and methods motivated by the specific needs and challenges of IR tasks.\n",

Our machine learning strategy leverages data generated from the improper system model and observational data from the actual system to create a neural network to model the dynamics of the actual system. We evaluate the proposed framework using numerical solutions obtained from three increasingly complex dynamical systems. Our results show that our system is capable of learning a data-driven model that provides accurate estimates of the system states both in previously unobserved regions as well as for future states. Our results show the power of state-of-the-art machine learning frameworks in estimating an accurate prior of the system's true dynamics that can be used for prediction up to a finite horizon.\n",

The noiseless sensor measurement corresponding to a normal process is 0, and the measurement is 1 if the process is anomalous. The decision-making algorithm is assumed to have no knowledge of the number of anomalous processes. The algorithm is allowed to choose a subset of the sensors at each time instant until the confidence level on the decision exceeds the desired value. Our objective is to design a sequential sensor selection policy that dynamically determines which processes to observe at each time and when to terminate the detection algorithm. The selection policy is designed such that the anomalous processes are detected with the desired confidence level while incurring minimum cost which comprises the delay in detection and the cost of sensing. We cast this problem as a sequential hypothesis testing problem within the framework of Markov decision processes, and solve it using the actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm. This deep neural network-based algorithm offers a low complexity solution with good detection accuracy. We also study the effect of statistical dependence between the processes on the algorithm performance. Through numerical experiments, we show that our algorithm is able to adapt to any unknown statistical dependence pattern of the processes.\n",

Complete and reliable labeling is often infeasible for large-scale and long-term sensor network deployments due to the labor and time overhead, limited availability of experts and missing ground truth. In addition, if the machine learning method used for analysis is sensitive to certain features of a deployment, labeling and learning needs to be repeated for every new deployment. To address these challenges, we propose to make use of system context information formalized in an information graph and embed it in the learning process via contrastive learning. Based on real-world data we show that this approach leads to an increased accuracy in case of weakly labeled data and leads to an increased robustness and transferability of the classifier to new sensor locations.\n",

However, in order to increase the quality of predictions and render machine learning solutions feasible for more complex applications, a substantial amount of training data is required. Although small machine learning models can be trained with modest amounts of data, the input for training larger models such as neural networks grows exponentially with the number of parameters. Since the demand for processing training data has outpaced the increase in computation power of computing machinery, there is a need for distributing the machine learning workload across multiple machines, and turning the centralized into a distributed system. These distributed systems present new challenges, first and foremost the efficient parallelization of the training process and the creation of a coherent model.

However, when the models are constructed by the means of empirical risk minimization, surrogate functions such as the logistic loss are optimized instead. This is done because the empirical approximations of the expected error and AUC functions are nonconvex and nonsmooth, and more importantly have zero derivative almost everywhere. In this work, we show that in the case of linear predictors, and under the assumption that the data has normal distribution, the expected error and the expected AUC are not only smooth, but have closed form expressions, which depend on the first and second moments of the normal distribution. Hence, we derive derivatives of these two functions and use these derivatives in an optimization algorithm to directly optimize the expected error and the AUC. In the case of real data sets, the derivatives can be approximated using empirical moments. We show that even when data is not normally distributed, computed derivatives are sufficiently useful to render an efficient optimization method and high quality solutions. Thus, we propose a gradient-based optimization method for direct optimization of the prediction error and AUC. Moreover, the per-iteration complexity of the proposed algorithm has no dependence on the size of the data set, unlike those for optimizing logistic regression and all other well known empirical risk minimization problems.\n",

While it is prevalent to outsource model training and serving tasks in the cloud, it is important to protect the privacy of sensitive samples in the training dataset and prevent information leakage to untrusted third parties. Past work have shown that a malicious machine learning service provider or end user can easily extract critical information about the training samples, from the model parameters or even just model outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel and generic methodology to preserve the privacy of training data in machine learning applications. Specifically we introduce an obfuscate function and apply it to the training data before feeding them to the model training task. This function adds random noise to existing samples, or augments the dataset with new samples. By doing so sensitive information about the properties of individual samples, or statistical properties of a group of samples, is hidden. Meanwhile the model trained from the obfuscated dataset can still achieve high accuracy. With this approach, the customers can safely disclose the data or models to third-party providers or end users without the need to worry about data privacy. Our experiments show that this approach can effective defeat four existing types of machine learning privacy attacks at negligible accuracy cost.\n",

Minimizing the reciprocals of these measures are the goals of supervised learning. However, when the models are constructed by the means of empirical risk minimization (ERM), surrogate functions such as the logistic loss or hinge loss are optimized instead. In this work, we show that in the case of linear predictors, the expected error and the expected ranking loss can be effectively approximated by smooth functions whose closed form expressions and those of their first (and second) order derivatives depend on the first and second moments of the data distribution, which can be precomputed. Hence, the complexity of an optimization algorithm applied to these functions does not depend on the size of the training data. These approximation functions are derived under the assumption that the output of the linear classifier for a given data set has an approximately normal distribution. We argue that this assumption is significantly weaker than the Gaussian assumption on the data itself and we support this claim by demonstrating that our new approximation is quite accurate on data sets that are not necessarily Gaussian. We present computational results that show that our proposed approximations and related optimization algorithms can produce linear classifiers with similar or better test accuracy or AUC, than those obtained using state-of-the-art approaches, in a fraction of the time.\n",

This poses many challenges to machine learning that are leading to the proposal of new methods and paradigms, in order to be able to deal with what is nowadays referred to as Big Data. In this paper we propose a method for the aggregation of different Bayesian network structures that have been learned from separate data sets, as a first step towards mining data sets that need to be partitioned in an horizontal way, i.e. with respect to the instances, in order to be processed. Considerations that should be taken into account when dealing with this situation are discussed. Scalable learning of Bayesian networks is slowly emerging, and our method constitutes one of the first insights into Gaussian Bayesian network aggregation from different sources. Tested on synthetic data it obtains good results that surpass those from individual learning. Future research will be focused on expanding the method and testing more diverse data sets.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[2] Title: Generative Adversarial Networks and Adversarial Autoencoders: Tutorial and Survey Abstract: This is a tutorial and survey paper on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), adversarial autoencoders, and their variants. We start with explaining adversarial learning and the vanilla GAN. Then, we explain the conditional GAN and DCGAN. The mode collapse problem is introduced and various methods, including minibatch GAN, unrolled GAN, BourGAN, mixture GAN, D2GAN, and Wasserstein GAN, are introduced for resolving this problem. Then, maximum likelihood estimation in GAN are explained along with f-GAN, adversarial variational Bayes, and Bayesian GAN. Then, we cover feature matching in GAN, InfoGAN, GRAN, LSGAN, energy-based GAN, CatGAN, MMD GAN, LapGAN, progressive GAN, triple GAN, LAG, GMAN, AdaGAN, CoGAN, inverse GAN, BiGAN, ALI, SAGAN, Few-shot GAN, SinGAN, and interpolation and evaluation of GAN. Then, we introduce some applications of GAN such as image-to-image translation (including PatchGAN, CycleGAN, DeepFaceDrawing, simulated GAN, interactive GAN), text-to-image translation (including StackGAN), and mixing image characteristics (including FineGAN and MixNMatch). Finally, we explain the autoencoders based on adversarial learning including adversarial autoencoder, PixelGAN, and implicit autoencoder.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[3] Title: A Variance Controlled Stochastic Method with Biased Estimation for Faster Non-convex Optimization Abstract: In this paper, we proposed a new technique, {\\\\em variance controlled stochastic gradient} (VCSG), to improve the performance of the stochastic variance reduced gradient (SVRG) algorithm. To avoid over-reducing the variance of gradient by SVRG, a hyper-parameter $\\\\lambda$ is introduced in VCSG that is able to control the reduced variance of SVRG. Theory shows that the optimization method can converge by using an unbiased gradient estimator, but in practice, biased gradient estimation can allow more efficient convergence to the vicinity since an unbiased approach is computationally more expensive. $\\\\lambda$ also has the effect of balancing the trade-off between unbiased and biased estimations. Secondly, to minimize the number of full gradient calculations in SVRG, a variance-bounded batch is introduced to reduce the number of gradient calculations required in each iteration. For smooth non-convex functions, the proposed algorithm converges to an approximate first-order stationary point (i.e. $\\\\mathbb{E}\\\\|\\\\nabla{f}(x)\\\\|^{2}\\\\leq\\\\epsilon$) within $\\\\mathcal{O}(min\\\\{1/\\\\epsilon^{3/2},n^{1/4}/\\\\epsilon\\\\})$ number of stochastic gradient evaluations, which improves the leading gradient complexity of stochastic gradient-based method SCS $(\\\\mathcal{O}(min\\\\{1/\\\\epsilon^{5/3},n^{2/3}/\\\\epsilon\\\\})$. It is shown theoretically and experimentally that VCSG can be deployed to improve convergence.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[4] Title: Training Discriminative Models to Evaluate Generative Ones Abstract: Generative models are known to be difficult to assess. Recent works, especially on generative adversarial networks (GANs), produce good visual samples of varied categories of images. However, the validation of their quality is still difficult to define and there is no existing agreement on the best evaluation process. This paper aims at making a step toward an objective evaluation process for generative models. It presents a new method to assess a trained generative model by evaluating the test accuracy of a classifier trained with generated data. The test set is composed of real images. Therefore, The classifier accuracy is used as a proxy to evaluate if the generative model fit the true data distribution. By comparing results with different generated datasets we are able to classify and compare generative models. The motivation of this approach is also to evaluate if generative models can help discriminative neural networks to learn, i.e., measure if training on generated data is able to make a model successful at testing on real settings. Our experiments compare different generators from the Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) frameworks on MNIST and fashion MNIST datasets. Our results show that none of the generative models is able to replace completely true data to train a discriminative model. But they also show that the initial GAN and WGAN are the best choices to generate on MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) and fashion MNIST database.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[5] Title: Bottom-Up Abstractive Summarization Abstract: Neural network-based methods for abstractive summarization produce outputs that are more fluent than other techniques, but which can be poor at content selection. This work proposes a simple technique for addressing this issue: use a data-efficient content selector to over-determine phrases in a source document that should be part of the summary. We use this selector as a bottom-up attention step to constrain the model to likely phrases. We show that this approach improves the ability to compress text, while still generating fluent summaries. This two-step process is both simpler and higher performing than other end-to-end content selection models, leading to significant improvements on ROUGE for both the CNN-DM and NYT corpus. Furthermore, the content selector can be trained with as little as 1,000 sentences, making it easy to transfer a trained summarizer to a new domain.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[6] Title: Hierarchical Amortized Training for Memory-efficient High Resolution 3D GAN Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have many potential medical imaging applications, including data augmentation, domain adaptation, and model explanation. Due to the limited memory of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), most current 3D GAN models are trained on low-resolution medical images, these models either cannot scale to high-resolution or are prone to patchy artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end GAN architecture that can generate high-resolution 3D images. We achieve this goal by using different configurations between training and inference. During training, we adopt a hierarchical structure that simultaneously generates a low-resolution version of the image and a randomly selected sub-volume of the high-resolution image. The hierarchical design has two advantages: First, the memory demand for training on high-resolution images is amortized among sub-volumes. Furthermore, anchoring the high-resolution sub-volumes to a single low-resolution image ensures anatomical consistency between sub-volumes. During inference, our model can directly generate full high-resolution images. We also incorporate an encoder with a similar hierarchical structure into the model to extract features from the images. Experiments on 3D thorax CT and brain MRI demonstrate that our approach outperforms state of the art in image generation. We also demonstrate clinical applications of the proposed model in data augmentation and clinical-relevant feature extraction.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[7] Title: Evaluation of Neural Network Classification Systems on Document Stream Abstract: One major drawback of state of the art Neural Networks (NN)-based approaches for document classification purposes is the large number of training samples required to obtain an efficient classification. The minimum required number is around one thousand annotated documents for each class. In many cases it is very difficult, if not impossible, to gather this number of samples in real industrial processes. In this paper, we analyse the efficiency of NN-based document classification systems in a sub-optimal training case, based on the situation of a company document stream. We evaluated three different approaches, one based on image content and two on textual content. The evaluation was divided into four parts: a reference case, to assess the performance of the system in the lab; two cases that each simulate a specific difficulty linked to document stream processing; and a realistic case that combined all of these difficulties. The realistic case highlighted the fact that there is a significant drop in the efficiency of NN-Based document classification systems. Although they remain efficient for well represented classes (with an over-fitting of the system for those classes), it is impossible for them to handle appropriately less well represented classes. NN-Based document classification systems need to be adapted to resolve these two problems before they can be considered for use in a company document stream.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[8] Title: Black-box Gradient Attack on Graph Neural Networks: Deeper Insights in Graph-based Attack and Defense Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received significant attention due to their state-of-the-art performance on various graph representation learning tasks. However, recent studies reveal that GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, i.e. an attacker is able to fool the GNNs by perturbing the graph structure or node features deliberately. While being able to successfully decrease the performance of GNNs, most existing attacking algorithms require access to either the model parameters or the training data, which is not practical in the real world. In this paper, we develop deeper insights into the Mettack algorithm, which is a representative grey-box attacking method, and then we propose a gradient-based black-box attacking algorithm. Firstly, we show that the Mettack algorithm will perturb the edges unevenly, thus the attack will be highly dependent on a specific training set. As a result, a simple yet useful strategy to defense against Mettack is to train the GNN with the validation set. Secondly, to overcome the drawbacks, we propose the Black-Box Gradient Attack (BBGA) algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that out proposed method is able to achieve stable attack performance without accessing the training sets of the GNNs. Further results shows that our proposed method is also applicable when attacking against various defense methods.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[9] Title: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning via Quantized Compressed Sensing Abstract: In this paper, we present a communication-efficient federated learning framework inspired by quantized compressed sensing. The presented framework consists of gradient compression for wireless devices and gradient reconstruction for a parameter server (PS). Our strategy for gradient compression is to sequentially perform block sparsification, dimensional reduction, and quantization. Thanks to gradient sparsification and quantization, our strategy can achieve a higher compression ratio than one-bit gradient compression. For accurate aggregation of the local gradients from the compressed signals at the PS, we put forth an approximate minimum mean square error (MMSE) approach for gradient reconstruction using the expectation-maximization generalized-approximate-message-passing (EM-GAMP) algorithm. Assuming Bernoulli Gaussian-mixture prior, this algorithm iteratively updates the posterior mean and variance of local gradients from the compressed signals. We also present a low-complexity approach for the gradient reconstruction. In this approach, we use the Bussgang theorem to aggregate local gradients from the compressed signals, then compute an approximate MMSE estimate of the aggregated gradient using the EM-GAMP algorithm. We also provide a convergence rate analysis of the presented framework. Using the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that the presented framework achieves almost identical performance with the case that performs no compression, while significantly reducing communication overhead for federated learning.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[10] Title: Quantizing data for distributed learning Abstract: We consider machine learning applications that train a model by leveraging data distributed over a trusted network, where communication constraints can create a performance bottleneck. A number of recent approaches propose to overcome this bottleneck through compression of gradient updates. However, as models become larger, so does the size of the gradient updates. In this paper, we propose an alternate approach to learn from distributed data that quantizes data instead of gradients, and can support learning over applications where the size of gradient updates is prohibitive. Our approach leverages the dependency of the computed gradient on data samples, which lie in a much smaller space in order to perform the quantization in the smaller dimension data space. At the cost of an extra gradient computation, the gradient estimate can be refined by conveying the difference between the gradient at the quantized data point and the original gradient using a small number of bits. Lastly, in order to save communication, our approach adds a layer that decides whether to transmit a quantized data sample or not based on its importance for learning. We analyze the convergence of the proposed approach for smooth convex and non-convex objective functions and show that we can achieve order optimal convergence rates with communication that mostly depends on the data rather than the model (gradient) dimension. We use our proposed algorithm to train ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, and show that we can achieve an order of magnitude savings over gradient compression methods. These communication savings come at the cost of increasing computation at the learning agent, and thus our approach is beneficial in scenarios where communication load is the main problem.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[11] Title: Semi-Supervised Learning with GANs: Revisiting Manifold Regularization Abstract: GANS are powerful generative models that are able to model the manifold of natural images. We leverage this property to perform manifold regularization by approximating the Laplacian norm using a Monte Carlo approximation that is easily computed with the GAN. When incorporated into the feature-matching GAN of Improved GAN, we achieve state-of-the-art results for GAN-based semi-supervised learning on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with a method that is significantly easier to implement than competing methods.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[12] Title: Chargrid: Towards Understanding 2D Documents Abstract: We introduce a novel type of text representation that preserves the 2D layout of a document. This is achieved by encoding each document page as a two-dimensional grid of characters. Based on this representation, we present a generic document understanding pipeline for structured documents. This pipeline makes use of a fully convolutional encoder-decoder network that predicts a segmentation mask and bounding boxes. We demonstrate its capabilities on an information extraction task from invoices and show that it significantly outperforms approaches based on sequential text or document images.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[13] Title: Document Image Classification with Intra-Domain Transfer Learning and Stacked Generalization of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Abstract: In this work, a region-based Deep Convolutional Neural Network framework is proposed for document structure learning. The contribution of this work involves efficient training of region based classifiers and effective ensembling for document image classification. A primary level of `inter-domain\\' transfer learning is used by exporting weights from a pre-trained VGG16 architecture on the ImageNet dataset to train a document classifier on whole document images. Exploiting the nature of region based influence modelling, a secondary level of `intra-domain\\' transfer learning is used for rapid training of deep learning models for image segments. Finally, stacked generalization based ensembling is utilized for combining the predictions of the base deep neural network models. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 92.2% on the popular RVL-CDIP document image dataset, exceeding benchmarks set by existing algorithms.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[14] Title: Residual-Aided End-to-End Learning of Communication System without Known Channel Abstract: Leveraging powerful deep learning techniques, the end-to-end (E2E) learning of communication system is able to outperform the classical communication system. Unfortunately, this communication system cannot be trained by deep learning without known channel. To deal with this problem, a generative adversarial network (GAN) based training scheme has been recently proposed to imitate the real channel. However, the gradient vanishing and overfitting problems of GAN will result in the serious performance degradation of E2E learning of communication system. To mitigate these two problems, we propose a residual aided GAN (RA-GAN) based training scheme in this paper. Particularly, inspired by the idea of residual learning, we propose a residual generator to mitigate the gradient vanishing problem by realizing a more robust gradient backpropagation. Moreover, to cope with the overfitting problem, we reconstruct the loss function for training by adding a regularizer, which limits the representation ability of RA-GAN. Simulation results show that the trained residual generator has better generation performance than the conventional generator, and the proposed RA-GAN based training scheme can achieve the near-optimal block error rate (BLER) performance with a negligible computational complexity increase in both the theoretical channel model and the ray-tracing based channel dataset.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[15] Title: Latent Topic Models for Hypertext Abstract: Latent topic models have been successfully applied as an unsupervised topic discovery technique in large document collections. With the proliferation of hypertext document collection such as the Internet, there has also been great interest in extending these approaches to hypertext [6, 9]. These approaches typically model links in an analogous fashion to how they model words - the document-link co-occurrence matrix is modeled in the same way that the document-word co-occurrence matrix is modeled in standard topic models. In this paper we present a probabilistic generative model for hypertext document collections that explicitly models the generation of links. Specifically, links from a word w to a document d depend directly on how frequent the topic of w is in d, in addition to the in-degree of d. We show how to perform EM learning on this model efficiently. By not modeling links as analogous to words, we end up using far fewer free parameters and obtain better link prediction results.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[16] Title: Unpaired High-Resolution and Scalable Style Transfer Using Generative Adversarial Networks Abstract: Neural networks have proven their capabilities by outperforming many other approaches on regression or classification tasks on various kinds of data. Other astonishing results have been achieved using neural nets as data generators, especially in settings of generative adversarial networks (GANs). One special application is the field of image domain translations. Here, the goal is to take an image with a certain style (e.g. a photography) and transform it into another one (e.g. a painting). If such a task is performed for unpaired training examples, the corresponding GAN setting is complex, the neural networks are large, and this leads to a high peak memory consumption during, both, training and evaluation phase. This sets a limit to the highest processable image size. We address this issue by the idea of not processing the whole image at once, but to train and evaluate the domain translation on the level of overlapping image subsamples. This new approach not only enables us to translate high-resolution images that otherwise cannot be processed by the neural network at once, but also allows us to work with comparably small neural networks and with limited hardware resources. Additionally, the number of images required for the training process is significantly reduced. We present high-quality results on images with a total resolution of up to over 50 megapixels and emonstrate that our method helps to preserve local image details while it also keeps global consistency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[17] Title: Topics and Label Propagation: Best of Both Worlds for Weakly Supervised Text Classification Abstract: We propose a Label Propagation based algorithm for weakly supervised text classification. We construct a graph where each document is represented by a node and edge weights represent similarities among the documents. Additionally, we discover underlying topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and enrich the document graph by including the topics in the form of additional nodes. The edge weights between a topic and a text document represent level of \"affinity\" between them. Our approach does not require document level labelling, instead it expects manual labels only for topic nodes. This significantly minimizes the level of supervision needed as only a few topics are observed to be enough for achieving sufficiently high accuracy. The Label Propagation Algorithm is employed on this enriched graph to propagate labels among the nodes. Our approach combines the advantages of Label Propagation (through document-document similarities) and Topic Modelling (for minimal but smart supervision). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various datasets and compare with state-of-the-art weakly supervised text classification approaches.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[18] Title: On Accelerating Distributed Convex Optimizations Abstract: This paper studies a distributed multi-agent convex optimization problem. The system comprises multiple agents in this problem, each with a set of local data points and an associated local cost function. The agents are connected to a server, and there is no inter-agent communication. The agents\\' goal is to learn a parameter vector that optimizes the aggregate of their local costs without revealing their local data points. In principle, the agents can solve this problem by collaborating with the server using the traditional distributed gradient-descent method. However, when the aggregate cost is ill-conditioned, the gradient-descent method (i) requires a large number of iterations to converge, and (ii) is highly unstable against process noise. We propose an iterative pre-conditioning technique to mitigate the deleterious effects of the cost function\\'s conditioning on the convergence rate of distributed gradient-descent. Unlike the conventional pre-conditioning techniques, the pre-conditioner matrix in our proposed technique updates iteratively to facilitate implementation on the distributed network. In the distributed setting, we provably show that the proposed algorithm converges linearly with an improved rate of convergence than the traditional and adaptive gradient-descent methods. Additionally, for the special case when the minimizer of the aggregate cost is unique, our algorithm converges superlinearly. We demonstrate our algorithm\\'s superior performance compared to prominent distributed algorithms for solving real logistic regression problems and emulating neural network training via a noisy quadratic model, thereby signifying the proposed algorithm\\'s efficiency for distributively solving non-convex optimization. Moreover, we empirically show that the proposed algorithm results in faster training without compromising the generalization performance.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[19] Title: NAS-BERT: Task-Agnostic and Adaptive-Size BERT Compression with Neural Architecture Search Abstract: While pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT) have achieved impressive results on different natural language processing tasks, they have large numbers of parameters and suffer from big computational and memory costs, which make them difficult for real-world deployment. Therefore, model compression is necessary to reduce the computation and memory cost of pre-trained models. In this work, we aim to compress BERT and address the following two challenging practical issues: (1) The compression algorithm should be able to output multiple compressed models with different sizes and latencies, in order to support devices with different memory and latency limitations; (2) The algorithm should be downstream task agnostic, so that the compressed models are generally applicable for different downstream tasks. We leverage techniques in neural architecture search (NAS) and propose NAS-BERT, an efficient method for BERT compression. NAS-BERT trains a big supernet on a search space containing a variety of architectures and outputs multiple compressed models with adaptive sizes and latency. Furthermore, the training of NAS-BERT is conducted on standard self-supervised pre-training tasks (e.g., masked language model) and does not depend on specific downstream tasks. Thus, the compressed models can be used across various downstream tasks. The technical challenge of NAS-BERT is that training a big supernet on the pre-training task is extremely costly. We employ several techniques including block-wise search, search space pruning, and performance approximation to improve search efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on GLUE and SQuAD benchmark datasets demonstrate that NAS-BERT can find lightweight models with better accuracy than previous approaches, and can be directly applied to different downstream tasks with adaptive model sizes for different requirements of memory or latency.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[20] Title: Hierarchical Attentional Hybrid Neural Networks for Document Classification Abstract: Document classification is a challenging task with important applications. The deep learning approaches to the problem have gained much attention recently. Despite the progress, the proposed models do not incorporate the knowledge of the document structure in the architecture efficiently and not take into account the contexting importance of words and sentences. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on a combination of convolutional neural networks, gated recurrent units, and attention mechanisms for document classification tasks. The main contribution of this work is the use of convolution layers to extract more meaningful, generalizable and abstract features by the hierarchical representation. The proposed method in this paper improves the results of the current attention-based approaches for document classification.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[21] Title: Parallel Blockwise Knowledge Distillation for Deep Neural Network Compression Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been extremely successful in solving many challenging AI tasks in natural language processing, speech recognition, and computer vision nowadays. However, DNNs are typically computation intensive, memory demanding, and power hungry, which significantly limits their usage on platforms with constrained resources. Therefore, a variety of compression techniques (e.g. quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation) have been proposed to reduce the size and power consumption of DNNs. Blockwise knowledge distillation is one of the compression techniques that can effectively reduce the size of a highly complex DNN. However, it is not widely adopted due to its long training time. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel blockwise distillation algorithm to accelerate the distillation process of sophisticated DNNs. Our algorithm leverages local information to conduct independent blockwise distillation, utilizes depthwise separable layers as the efficient replacement block architecture, and properly addresses limiting factors (e.g. dependency, synchronization, and load balancing) that affect parallelism. The experimental results running on an AMD server with four Geforce RTX 2080Ti GPUs show that our algorithm can achieve 3x speedup plus 19% energy savings on VGG distillation, and 3.5x speedup plus 29% energy savings on ResNet distillation, both with negligible accuracy loss. The speedup of ResNet distillation can be further improved to 3.87 when using four RTX6000 GPUs in a distributed cluster.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[22] Title: Personalized Medical Treatments Using Novel Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Abstract: In both the fields of computer science and medicine there is very strong interest in developing personalized treatment policies for patients who have variable responses to treatments. In particular, I aim to find an optimal personalized treatment policy which is a non-deterministic function of the patient specific covariate data that maximizes the expected survival time or clinical outcome. I developed an algorithmic framework to solve multistage decision problem with a varying number of stages that are subject to censoring in which the \"rewards\" are expected survival times. In specific, I developed a novel Q-learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts for these parameters. Furthermore, I found finite upper bounds on the generalized error of the treatment paths constructed by this algorithm. I have also shown that when the optimal Q-function is an element of the approximation space, the anticipated survival times for the treatment regime constructed by the algorithm will converge to the optimal treatment path. I demonstrated the performance of the proposed algorithmic framework via simulation studies and through the analysis of chronic depression data and a hypothetical clinical trial. The censored Q-learning algorithm I developed is more effective than the state of the art clinical decision support systems and is able to operate in environments when many covariate parameters may be unobtainable or censored.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[23] Title: Generative Adversarial Networks for Extreme Learned Image Compression Abstract: We present a learned image compression system based on GANs, operating at extremely low bitrates. Our proposed framework combines an encoder, decoder/generator and a multi-scale discriminator, which we train jointly for a generative learned compression objective. The model synthesizes details it cannot afford to store, obtaining visually pleasing results at bitrates where previous methods fail and show strong artifacts. Furthermore, if a semantic label map of the original image is available, our method can fully synthesize unimportant regions in the decoded image such as streets and trees from the label map, proportionally reducing the storage cost. A user study confirms that for low bitrates, our approach is preferred to state-of-the-art methods, even when they use more than double the bits.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[24] Title: A Comparative Study on Different Types of Approaches to Bengali document Categorization Abstract: Document categorization is a technique where the category of a document is determined. In this paper three well-known supervised learning techniques which are Support Vector Machine(SVM), Na\\\\\"ive Bayes(NB) and Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) compared for Bengali document categorization. Besides classifier, classification also depends on how feature is selected from dataset. For analyzing those classifier performances on predicting a document against twelve categories several feature selection techniques are also applied in this article namely Chi square distribution, normalized TFIDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) with word analyzer. So, we attempt to explore the efficiency of those three-classification algorithms by using two different feature selection techniques in this article.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[25] Title: Graph-based Deep Generative Modelling for Document Layout Generation Abstract: One of the major prerequisites for any deep learning approach is the availability of large-scale training data. When dealing with scanned document images in real world scenarios, the principal information of its content is stored in the layout itself. In this work, we have proposed an automated deep generative model using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to generate synthetic data with highly variable and plausible document layouts that can be used to train document interpretation systems, in this case, specially in digital mailroom applications. It is also the first graph-based approach for document layout generation task experimented on administrative document images, in this case, invoices.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[26] Title: Document classification methods Abstract: Information on different fields which are collected by users requires appropriate management and organization to be structured in a standard way and retrieved fast and more easily. Document classification is a conventional method to separate text based on their subjects among scientific text, web pages and digital library. Different methods and techniques are proposed for document classifications that have advantages and deficiencies. In this paper, several unsupervised and supervised document classification methods are studied and compared.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[27] Title: Neural Methods for Effective, Efficient, and Exposure-Aware Information Retrieval Abstract: Neural networks with deep architectures have demonstrated significant performance improvements in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing. The challenges in information retrieval (IR), however, are different from these other application areas. A common form of IR involves ranking of documents--or short passages--in response to keyword-based queries. Effective IR systems must deal with query-document vocabulary mismatch problem, by modeling relationships between different query and document terms and how they indicate relevance. Models should also consider lexical matches when the query contains rare terms--such as a person\\'s name or a product model number--not seen during training, and to avoid retrieving semantically related but irrelevant results. In many real-life IR tasks, the retrieval involves extremely large collections--such as the document index of a commercial Web search engine--containing billions of documents. Efficient IR methods should take advantage of specialized IR data structures, such as inverted index, to efficiently retrieve from large collections. Given an information need, the IR system also mediates how much exposure an information artifact receives by deciding whether it should be displayed, and where it should be positioned, among other results. Exposure-aware IR systems may optimize for additional objectives, besides relevance, such as parity of exposure for retrieved items and content publishers. In this thesis, we present novel neural architectures and methods motivated by the specific needs and challenges of IR tasks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[28] Title: Content Modeling Using Latent Permutations Abstract: We present a novel Bayesian topic model for learning discourse-level document structure. Our model leverages insights from discourse theory to constrain latent topic assignments in a way that reflects the underlying organization of document topics. We propose a global model in which both topic selection and ordering are biased to be similar across a collection of related documents. We show that this space of orderings can be effectively represented using a distribution over permutations called the Generalized Mallows Model. We apply our method to three complementary discourse-level tasks: cross-document alignment, document segmentation, and information ordering. Our experiments show that incorporating our permutation-based model in these applications yields substantial improvements in performance over previously proposed methods.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[29] Title: Nonparametric Relational Topic Models through Dependent Gamma Processes Abstract: Traditional Relational Topic Models provide a way to discover the hidden topics from a document network. Many theoretical and practical tasks, such as dimensional reduction, document clustering, link prediction, benefit from this revealed knowledge. However, existing relational topic models are based on an assumption that the number of hidden topics is known in advance, and this is impractical in many real-world applications. Therefore, in order to relax this assumption, we propose a nonparametric relational topic model in this paper. Instead of using fixed-dimensional probability distributions in its generative model, we use stochastic processes. Specifically, a gamma process is assigned to each document, which represents the topic interest of this document. Although this method provides an elegant solution, it brings additional challenges when mathematically modeling the inherent network structure of typical document network, i.e., two spatially closer documents tend to have more similar topics. Furthermore, we require that the topics are shared by all the documents. In order to resolve these challenges, we use a subsampling strategy to assign each document a different gamma process from the global gamma process, and the subsampling probabilities of documents are assigned with a Markov Random Field constraint that inherits the document network structure. Through the designed posterior inference algorithm, we can discover the hidden topics and its number simultaneously. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world network datasets demonstrate the capabilities of learning the hidden topics and, more importantly, the number of topics.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[30] Title: Learning One-Shot Imitation from Humans without Humans Abstract: Humans can naturally learn to execute a new task by seeing it performed by other individuals once, and then reproduce it in a variety of configurations. Endowing robots with this ability of imitating humans from third person is a very immediate and natural way of teaching new tasks. Only recently, through meta-learning, there have been successful attempts to one-shot imitation learning from humans; however, these approaches require a lot of human resources to collect the data in the real world to train the robot. But is there a way to remove the need for real world human demonstrations during training? We show that with Task-Embedded Control Networks, we can infer control polices by embedding human demonstrations that can condition a control policy and achieve one-shot imitation learning. Importantly, we do not use a real human arm to supply demonstrations during training, but instead leverage domain randomisation in an application that has not been seen before: sim-to-real transfer on humans. Upon evaluating our approach on pushing and placing tasks in both simulation and in the real world, we show that in comparison to a system that was trained on real-world data we are able to achieve similar results by utilising only simulation data.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[31] Title: Stochastic Super-Resolution for Downscaling Time-Evolving Atmospheric Fields with a Generative Adversarial Network Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been recently adopted for super-resolution, an application closely related to what is referred to as \"downscaling\" in the atmospheric sciences: improving the spatial resolution of low-resolution images. The ability of conditional GANs to generate an ensemble of solutions for a given input lends itself naturally to stochastic downscaling, but the stochastic nature of GANs is not usually considered in super-resolution applications. Here, we introduce a recurrent, stochastic super-resolution GAN that can generate ensembles of time-evolving high-resolution atmospheric fields for an input consisting of a low-resolution sequence of images of the same field. We test the GAN using two datasets, one consisting of radar-measured precipitation from Switzerland, the other of cloud optical thickness derived from the Geostationary Earth Observing Satellite 16 (GOES-16). We find that the GAN can generate realistic, temporally consistent super-resolution sequences for both datasets. The statistical properties of the generated ensemble are analyzed using rank statistics, a method adapted from ensemble weather forecasting; these analyses indicate that the GAN produces close to the correct amount of variability in its outputs. As the GAN generator is fully convolutional, it can be applied after training to input images larger than the images used to train it. It is also able to generate time series much longer than the training sequences, as demonstrated by applying the generator to a three-month dataset of the precipitation radar data. The source code to our GAN is available at https://github.com/jleinonen/downscaling-rnn-gan.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[32] Title: Learning to Weight for Text Classification Abstract: In information retrieval (IR) and related tasks, term weighting approaches typically consider the frequency of the term in the document and in the collection in order to compute a score reflecting the importance of the term for the document. In tasks characterized by the presence of training data (such as text classification) it seems logical that the term weighting function should take into account the distribution (as estimated from training data) of the term across the classes of interest. Although `supervised term weighting\\' approaches that use this intuition have been described before, they have failed to show consistent improvements. In this article we analyse the possible reasons for this failure, and call consolidated assumptions into question. Following this criticism we propose a novel supervised term weighting approach that, instead of relying on any predefined formula, learns a term weighting function optimised on the training set of interest; we dub this approach \\\\emph{Learning to Weight} (LTW). The experiments that we run on several well-known benchmarks, and using different learning methods, show that our method outperforms previous term weighting approaches in text classification.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[33] Title: Boosting Entity Linking Performance by Leveraging Unlabeled Documents Abstract: Modern entity linking systems rely on large collections of documents specifically annotated for the task (e.g., AIDA CoNLL). In contrast, we propose an approach which exploits only naturally occurring information: unlabeled documents and Wikipedia. Our approach consists of two stages. First, we construct a high recall list of candidate entities for each mention in an unlabeled document. Second, we use the candidate lists as weak supervision to constrain our document-level entity linking model. The model treats entities as latent variables and, when estimated on a collection of unlabelled texts, learns to choose entities relying both on local context of each mention and on coherence with other entities in the document. The resulting approach rivals fully-supervised state-of-the-art systems on standard test sets. It also approaches their performance in the very challenging setting: when tested on a test set sampled from the data used to estimate the supervised systems. By comparing to Wikipedia-only training of our model, we demonstrate that modeling unlabeled documents is beneficial.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[34] Title: Knowledge Distillation in Document Retrieval Abstract: Complex deep learning models now achieve state of the art performance for many document retrieval tasks. The best models process the query or claim jointly with the document. However for fast scalable search it is desirable to have document embeddings which are independent of the claim. In this paper we show that knowledge distillation can be used to encourage a model that generates claim independent document encodings to mimic the behavior of a more complex model which generates claim dependent encodings. We explore this approach in document retrieval for a fact extraction and verification task. We show that by using the soft labels from a complex cross attention teacher model, the performance of claim independent student LSTM or CNN models is improved across all the ranking metrics. The student models we use are 12x faster in runtime and 20x smaller in number of parameters than the teacher\\n\\n---\\n\\n[35] Title: A Data-Centric Approach for Training Deep Neural Networks with Less Data Abstract: While the availability of large datasets is perceived to be a key requirement for training deep neural networks, it is possible to train such models with relatively little data. However, compensating for the absence of large datasets demands a series of actions to enhance the quality of the existing samples and to generate new ones. This paper summarizes our winning submission to the \"Data-Centric AI\" competition. We discuss some of the challenges that arise while training with a small dataset, offer a principled approach for systematic data quality enhancement, and propose a GAN-based solution for synthesizing new data points. Our evaluations indicate that the dataset generated by the proposed pipeline offers 5% accuracy improvement while being significantly smaller than the baseline.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[36] Title: A Survey on Generative Adversarial Networks: Variants, Applications, and Training Abstract: The Generative Models have gained considerable attention in the field of unsupervised learning via a new and practical framework called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) due to its outstanding data generation capability. Many models of GAN have proposed, and several practical applications emerged in various domains of computer vision and machine learning. Despite GAN\\'s excellent success, there are still obstacles to stable training. The problems are due to Nash-equilibrium, internal covariate shift, mode collapse, vanishing gradient, and lack of proper evaluation metrics. Therefore, stable training is a crucial issue in different applications for the success of GAN. Herein, we survey several training solutions proposed by different researchers to stabilize GAN training. We survey, (I) the original GAN model and its modified classical versions, (II) detail analysis of various GAN applications in different domains, (III) detail study about the various GAN training obstacles as well as training solutions. Finally, we discuss several new issues as well as research outlines to the topic.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[37] Title: GAN Compression: Efficient Architectures for Interactive Conditional GANs Abstract: Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) have enabled controllable image synthesis for many vision and graphics applications. However, recent cGANs are 1-2 orders of magnitude more compute-intensive than modern recognition CNNs. For example, GauGAN consumes 281G MACs per image, compared to 0.44G MACs for MobileNet-v3, making it difficult for interactive deployment. In this work, we propose a general-purpose compression framework for reducing the inference time and model size of the generator in cGANs. Directly applying existing compression methods yields poor performance due to the difficulty of GAN training and the differences in generator architectures. We address these challenges in two ways. First, to stabilize GAN training, we transfer knowledge of multiple intermediate representations of the original model to its compressed model and unify unpaired and paired learning. Second, instead of reusing existing CNN designs, our method finds efficient architectures via neural architecture search. To accelerate the search process, we decouple the model training and search via weight sharing. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across different supervision settings, network architectures, and learning methods. Without losing image quality, we reduce the computation of CycleGAN by 21x, Pix2pix by 12x, MUNIT by 29x, and GauGAN by 9x, paving the way for interactive image synthesis.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[38] Title: Sequence-to-Set Semantic Tagging: End-to-End Multi-label Prediction using Neural Attention for Complex Query Reformulation and Automated Text Categorization Abstract: Novel contexts may often arise in complex querying scenarios such as in evidence-based medicine (EBM) involving biomedical literature, that may not explicitly refer to entities or canonical concept forms occurring in any fact- or rule-based knowledge source such as an ontology like the UMLS. Moreover, hidden associations between candidate concepts meaningful in the current context, may not exist within a single document, but within the collection, via alternate lexical forms. Therefore, inspired by the recent success of sequence-to-sequence neural models in delivering the state-of-the-art in a wide range of NLP tasks, we develop a novel sequence-to-set framework with neural attention for learning document representations that can effect term transfer within the corpus, for semantically tagging a large collection of documents. We demonstrate that our proposed method can be effective in both a supervised multi-label classification setup for text categorization, as well as in a unique unsupervised setting with no human-annotated document labels that uses no external knowledge resources and only corpus-derived term statistics to drive the training. Further, we show that semi-supervised training using our architecture on large amounts of unlabeled data can augment performance on the text categorization task when limited labeled data is available. Our approach to generate document encodings employing our sequence-to-set models for inference of semantic tags, gives to the best of our knowledge, the state-of-the-art for both, the unsupervised query expansion task for the TREC CDS 2016 challenge dataset when evaluated on an Okapi BM25--based document retrieval system; and also over the MLTM baseline (Soleimani et al, 2016), for both supervised and semi-supervised multi-label prediction tasks on the del.icio.us and Ohsumed datasets. We will make our code and data publicly available.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[39] Title: Leveraging Over Priors for Boosting Control of Prosthetic Hands Abstract: The Electromyography (EMG) signal is the electrical activity produced by cells of skeletal muscles in order to provide a movement. The non-invasive prosthetic hand works with several electrodes, placed on the stump of an amputee, that record this signal. In order to favour the control of prosthesis, the EMG signal is analyzed with algorithms based on machine learning theory to decide the movement that the subject is going to do. In order to obtain a significant control of the prosthesis and avoid mismatch between desired and performed movements, a long training period is needed when we use the traditional algorithm of machine learning (i.e. Support Vector Machines). An actual challenge in this field concerns the reduction of the time necessary for an amputee to learn how to use the prosthesis. Recently, several algorithms that exploit a form of prior knowledge have been proposed. In general, we refer to prior knowledge as a past experience available in the form of models. In our case an amputee, that attempts to perform some movements with the prosthesis, could use experience from different subjects that are already able to perform those movements. The aim of this work is to verify, with a computational investigation, if for an amputee this kind of previous experience is useful in order to reduce the training time and boost the prosthetic control. Furthermore, we want to understand if and how the final results change when the previous knowledge of intact or amputated subjects is used for a new amputee. Our experiments indicate that: (1) the use of experience, from other subjects already trained to perform a task, makes us able to reduce the training time of about an order of magnitude; (2) it seems that an amputee that\\n\\n---\\n\\n[40] Title: Evaluation of Deep Convolutional Nets for Document Image Classification and Retrieval Abstract: This paper presents a new state-of-the-art for document image classification and retrieval, using features learned by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In object and scene analysis, deep neural nets are capable of learning a hierarchical chain of abstraction from pixel inputs to concise and descriptive representations. The current work explores this capacity in the realm of document analysis, and confirms that this representation strategy is superior to a variety of popular hand-crafted alternatives. Experiments also show that (i) features extracted from CNNs are robust to compression, (ii) CNNs trained on non-document images transfer well to document analysis tasks, and (iii) enforcing region-specific feature-learning is unnecessary given sufficient training data. This work also makes available a new labelled subset of the IIT-CDIP collection, containing 400,000 document images across 16 categories, useful for training new CNNs for document analysis.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[41] Title: Communication-Efficient Distributed SGD with Compressed Sensing Abstract: We consider large scale distributed optimization over a set of edge devices connected to a central server, where the limited communication bandwidth between the server and edge devices imposes a significant bottleneck for the optimization procedure. Inspired by recent advances in federated learning, we propose a distributed stochastic gradient descent (SGD) type algorithm that exploits the sparsity of the gradient, when possible, to reduce communication burden. At the heart of the algorithm is to use compressed sensing techniques for the compression of the local stochastic gradients at the device side; and at the server side, a sparse approximation of the global stochastic gradient is recovered from the noisy aggregated compressed local gradients. We conduct theoretical analysis on the convergence of our algorithm in the presence of noise perturbation incurred by the communication channels, and also conduct numerical experiments to corroborate its effectiveness.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[42] Title: How Generative Adversarial Networks and Their Variants Work: An Overview Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) have received wide attention in the machine learning field for their potential to learn high-dimensional, complex real data distribution. Specifically, they do not rely on any assumptions about the distribution and can generate real-like samples from latent space in a simple manner. This powerful property leads GAN to be applied to various applications such as image synthesis, image attribute editing, image translation, domain adaptation and other academic fields. In this paper, we aim to discuss the details of GAN for those readers who are familiar with, but do not comprehend GAN deeply or who wish to view GAN from various perspectives. In addition, we explain how GAN operates and the fundamental meaning of various objective functions that have been suggested recently. We then focus on how the GAN can be combined with an autoencoder framework. Finally, we enumerate the GAN variants that are applied to various tasks and other fields for those who are interested in exploiting GAN for their research.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[43] Title: The Training of Neuromodels for Machine Comprehension of Text. Brain2Text Algorithm Abstract: Nowadays, the Internet represents a vast informational space, growing exponentially and the problem of search for relevant data becomes essential as never before. The algorithm proposed in the article allows to perform natural language queries on content of the document and get comprehensive meaningful answers. The problem is partially solved for English as SQuAD contains enough data to learn on, but there is no such dataset in Russian, so the methods used by scientists now are not applicable to Russian. Brain2 framework allows to cope with the problem - it stands out for its ability to be applied on small datasets and does not require impressive computing power. The algorithm is illustrated on Sberbank of Russia Strategy\\'s text and assumes the use of a neuromodel consisting of 65 mln synapses. The trained model is able to construct word-by-word answers to questions based on a given text. The existing limitations are its current inability to identify synonyms, pronoun relations and allegories. Nevertheless, the results of conducted experiments showed high capacity and generalisation ability of the suggested approach.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[44] Title: Active Generative Adversarial Network for Image Classification Abstract: Sufficient supervised information is crucial for any machine learning models to boost performance. However, labeling data is expensive and sometimes difficult to obtain. Active learning is an approach to acquire annotations for data from a human oracle by selecting informative samples with a high probability to enhance performance. In recent emerging studies, a generative adversarial network (GAN) has been integrated with active learning to generate good candidates to be presented to the oracle. In this paper, we propose a novel model that is able to obtain labels for data in a cheaper manner without the need to query an oracle. In the model, a novel reward for each sample is devised to measure the degree of uncertainty, which is obtained from a classifier trained with existing labeled data. This reward is used to guide a conditional GAN to generate informative samples with a higher probability for a certain label. With extensive evaluations, we have confirmed the effectiveness of the model, showing that the generated samples are capable of improving the classification performance in popular image classification tasks.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[45] Title: Adversarial sampling of unknown and high-dimensional conditional distributions Abstract: Many engineering problems require the prediction of realization-to-realization variability or a refined description of modeled quantities. In that case, it is necessary to sample elements from unknown high-dimensional spaces with possibly millions of degrees of freedom. While there exist methods able to sample elements from probability density functions (PDF) with known shapes, several approximations need to be made when the distribution is unknown. In this paper the sampling method, as well as the inference of the underlying distribution, are both handled with a data-driven method known as generative adversarial networks (GAN), which trains two competing neural networks to produce a network that can effectively generate samples from the training set distribution. In practice, it is often necessary to draw samples from conditional distributions. When the conditional variables are continuous, only one (if any) data point corresponding to a particular value of a conditioning variable may be available, which is not sufficient to estimate the conditional distribution. This work handles this problem using an a priori estimation of the conditional moments of a PDF. Two approaches, stochastic estimation, and an external neural network are compared here for computing these moments; however, any preferred method can be used. The algorithm is demonstrated in the case of the deconvolution of a filtered turbulent flow field. It is shown that all the versions of the proposed algorithm effectively sample the target conditional distribution with minimal impact on the quality of the samples compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the procedure can be used as a metric for the diversity of samples generated by a conditional GAN (cGAN) conditioned with continuous variables.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[46] Title: Relational Data Synthesis using Generative Adversarial Networks: A Design Space Exploration Abstract: The proliferation of big data has brought an urgent demand for privacy-preserving data publishing. Traditional solutions to this demand have limitations on effectively balancing the tradeoff between privacy and utility of the released data. Thus, the database community and machine learning community have recently studied a new problem of relational data synthesis using generative adversarial networks (GAN) and proposed various algorithms. However, these algorithms are not compared under the same framework and thus it is hard for practitioners to understand GAN\\'s benefits and limitations. To bridge the gaps, we conduct so far the most comprehensive experimental study that investigates applying GAN to relational data synthesis. We introduce a unified GAN-based framework and define a space of design solutions for each component in the framework, including neural network architectures and training strategies. We conduct extensive experiments to explore the design space and compare with traditional data synthesis approaches. Through extensive experiments, we find that GAN is very promising for relational data synthesis, and provide guidance for selecting appropriate design solutions. We also point out limitations of GAN and identify future research directions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[47] Title: GAN You Do the GAN GAN? Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have become a dominant class of generative models. In recent years, GAN variants have yielded especially impressive results in the synthesis of a variety of forms of data. Examples include compelling natural and artistic images, textures, musical sequences, and 3D object files. However, one obvious synthesis candidate is missing. In this work, we answer one of deep learning\\'s most pressing questions: GAN you do the GAN GAN? That is, is it possible to train a GAN to model a distribution of GANs? We release the full source code for this project under the MIT license.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[48] Title: ErrorCompensatedX: error compensation for variance reduced algorithms Abstract: Communication cost is one major bottleneck for the scalability for distributed learning. One approach to reduce the communication cost is to compress the gradient during communication. However, directly compressing the gradient decelerates the convergence speed, and the resulting algorithm may diverge for biased compression. Recent work addressed this problem for stochastic gradient descent by adding back the compression error from the previous step. This idea was further extended to one class of variance reduced algorithms, where the variance of the stochastic gradient is reduced by taking a moving average over all history gradients. However, our analysis shows that just adding the previous step\\'s compression error, as done in existing work, does not fully compensate the compression error. So, we propose ErrorCompensatedX, which uses the compression error from the previous two steps. We show that ErrorCompensatedX can achieve the same asymptotic convergence rate with the training without compression. Moreover, we provide a unified theoretical analysis framework for this class of variance reduced algorithms, with or without error compensation.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[49] Title: Improving Persian Document Classification Using Semantic Relations between Words Abstract: With the increase of information, document classification as one of the methods of text mining, plays vital role in many management and organizing information. Document classification is the process of assigning a document to one or more predefined category labels. Document classification includes different parts such as text processing, term selection, term weighting and final classification. The accuracy of document classification is very important. Thus improvement in each part of classification should lead to better results and higher precision. Term weighting has a great impact on the accuracy of the classification. Most of the existing weighting methods exploit the statistical information of terms in documents and do not consider semantic relations between words. In this paper, an automated document classification system is presented that uses a novel term weighting method based on semantic relations between terms. To evaluate the proposed method, three standard Persian corpuses are used. Experiment results show 2 to 4 percent improvement in classification accuracy compared with the best previous designed system for Persian documents.\\n\\n---\\n\\n[50] Title: Open-Set Support Vector Machines Abstract: Often, when dealing with real-world recognition problems, we do not need, and often cannot have, knowledge of the entire set of possible classes that might appear during operational testing. In such cases, we need to think of robust classification methods able to deal with the \"unknown\" and properly reject samples belonging to classes never seen during training. Notwithstanding, existing classifiers to date were mostly developed for the closed-set scenario, i.e., the classification setup in which it is assumed that all test samples belong to one of the classes with which the classifier was trained. In the open-set scenario, however, a test sample can belong to none of the known classes and the classifier must properly reject it by classifying it as unknown. In this work, we extend upon the well-known Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier and introduce the Open-Set Support Vector Machines (OSSVM), which is suitable for recognition in open-set setups. OSSVM balances the empirical risk and the risk of the unknown and ensures that the region of the feature space in which a test sample would be classified as known (one of the known classes) is always bounded, ensuring a finite risk of the unknown. In this work, we also highlight the properties of the SVM classifier related to the open-set scenario, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for an RBF SVM to have bounded open-space risk.\\n\\nYour ranking (most to least relevant):<end_of_turn>\\n<start_of_turn>model\\n[9] > [10] > [18] > [21] > [41] > [1] > [2] > [3] > [4] > [5] > [6] > [7] > [8] > [11] > [12] > [13] > [14] > [15] > [16] > [17] > [19] > [20] > [22] > [23] > [24] > [25] > [26] > [27] > [28] > [29] > [30] > [31] > [32] > [33] > [34] > [35] > [36] > [37] > [38] > [39] > [40] > [42] > [43] > [44] > [45] > [46] > [47] > [48] > [49] > [50]<end_of_turn>\\n'"
